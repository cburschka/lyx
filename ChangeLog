	Inset::Clone(Buffer const &) to Inset::Clone().

	* src/CutAndPaste.C:

	* acconfig.h, configure.in, config/lyxinclude.m4: Added autoconf tests
	to check for systems where mkstemp() is available but not declared
	in headers. The new autoconf macro lyx_CHECK_DECL can be used
	to check for declarations in headers.
                 
2000-11-23  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* forms/bibforms.fd: tiny fix to get it to run with fdesign.

	* forms/makefile: added bibforms.fd, include_form.fd.
	Removed lyx_sendfax.fd.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog):
	* src/LyXAction.C (init):
	* src/bufferparams.C (readLanguage): altered messages as suggested by
	John Levon.

	* src/LyXView.C (c-tor): connected RedrawAllBufferRelatedDialogs() to
	Dialogs::redrawGUI.

	* src/credits.C: made fd_form_credits non-static, so that it can be
	redrawn should the xforms colors be re-mapped.
	* src/spellchecker.C ditto fd_form_spell_options.

	* src/filedlg.[Ch] (redraw):

2000-11-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/version.h: try the pre2 again

2000-11-22  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/kde/Dialogs.C: added signal Dialogs::redrawGUI.

	* src/frontends/kde/FormParagraph.C: added using directive.

	* src/frontends/kde/paradlg.C: added config.h and using directive.

	* src/frontends/kde/paradlg.h: added std::qualifier.

	* src/frontends/kde/Makefile.am: added Color.lo to libkde_la_OBJADD.

2000-11-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): don't output src/xtl/Makefile

	* src/lyx_sendfax.[Ch]  src/lyx_sendfax_main.C: delete files

2000-11-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/version.h: set back to 1.1.6cvs

2000-11-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/version.h: set to 1.1.6pre2

2000-11-20  Marko Vendelin <markov@ioc.ee>

	* src/frontends/gnome/Dialogs.C: added signal Dialogs::redrawGUI

	* src/frontends/gnome/Makefile.am: updated list of XForms object files
              
2000-11-21  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/LColor.C (init):
	* src/lyxrc.C (getDescription): changed some comments as suggested by
	John Levon.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch]: modified to connect and
	disconnect the redrawGUI signal in best-practice fashion.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]: renamed usage_tab_ as
	long_opts_tab to reflect the change in name of this tabfolder, as
	suggested by John Levon.
	(connect, disconnect): new methods. Don't do much at present other than
	ensuring that we can't resize the dialog. This just makes xforms go
	crazy.
	(lots of methods in Colors): made void rather than bool. The idea is
	to have an isOk() function that keeps track of whether any input is
	genuinely invalid and should therefore block Save, Apply.
	Easier to manipulate the counters rapidly.
	(Colors::InputBrowserLyX, Colors::Modify): rewritten so that Amir's
	compiler will like this code. Much cleaner way of doing things.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/fdfix.sh: a little speed up fix.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: used normal counters
	rather than simple counters, following suggestion by John Levon.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_print.fd: used labelframe rather
	than engraved frame + text.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/makefile: removed spurious command.

2000-11-17  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/LColor.C (c-tor): fixed a couple of items in the ColorEntry
	array. 
	* src/LyXAction.C (init): LFUN_SET_COLOR now has the attrib
	ReadOnly|NoBuffer.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.C: (HSVColor c-tor): another bug fix.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: re-formatted so that I can
	see what Lars has changed and what is just white space!
	Now used X directly to ascertain the RGB color associated with the
	color name.
	Replaced the RGB sliders with HSV equivalent. Should be more intuitive
	to use.
	Added some sort capability.
	The X11 color name database input is only displayed if the database
	isn't found in the standard place.
	Got rid of struct compare_converter; it wasn't used.
	Probably some other stuff that I've forgotten.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.h: changed the names of some
	methods in the Colors struct. Added a couple of structs to help sort
	colors by name and by RGBColor.

	* src/frontends/xforms/xform_helpers.[Ch]: moved the ReadableDir etc
	functions into a new class RWInfo.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_citation.fd: Added some shortcuts.
	The dialog is now almost navigable using the keyboard. Unfortunately,
	the cursor has to be inside a browser for it to be activated. There is
	no visual feedback for the key shortcuts to the arrow keys (use
	Alt-appropriate arrow key, Alt-x).

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: hacked the Colors tab
	around a lot.

	* src/support/filetools.[Ch]: moved out ReadableFile etc and into
	xform_helpers.[Ch]. See above.

2000-11-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_PROG_CXX): please somebody

	* src/screen.C (setCursorColor): new method. Sets the color of the
	cursor. 
	(ShowManualCursor): call it.
	Constify some local variables.

	* src/LColor.[Ch] (LColor): add entry for cursor
	* lib/configure(.m4) (word_to_latex_command): add quotes, removes
	a warning.

2000-11-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (draw): fixed text border redraw problem.
	(calculate_dimensions_of_cells): try to boost up when inserting chars.

2000-11-15  Rob Lahaye  <lahaye@postech.edu>

	* lib/ui/default.ui: OptItem used for Fax entry

2000-11-17  Matej Cepl  <cepl@bigfoot.com>

	* lib/kbd/czech.kmap: add apostroph mark to the Czech keyboard.

2000-11-15  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): fix so it can handle length phrases like
		"10mm+-20mm", "40inplus16mmminus10cm" etc.

2000-11-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: constify several variables
	(BrowserLyX): rewrite to not need the choice variable
	(Modify): rewrite to not need the choide variable
	(compare_converter): make operator const

	* src/lyxrc.C (output): be a bit nicer og os usage, and try to
	correct the writing of \set_color
	(getDescription): return a const string

	* src/kbsequence.[Ch] (addkey): remove dead code

	* src/Painter.C (text): remove some commented code

2000-11-15  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/ColorHandler.[Ch]: removed some header files from .h file.
	Included LColor.h in .C file.

	* src/LColor.[Ch]: made class copyable so that I could create a
	system_lcolor instance.

	* src/Painter.h: removed LColor.h.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): used AddName.

	* src/lyx_main.C (init): copied lcolor to system_lcolr prior to reading
	of user preferences/lyxrc file.

	* src/lyxrc.C (output): output changes to lcolor.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.[Ch]: Changed X11Color to a new struct,
	NamedColor.
	Moved class xformColor to files xform_helpers.[Ch]. These files,
	Color.[Ch], could now be moved into src if they would be useful to
	other GUIs.

	* src/frontends/xforms/xform_helpers.[Ch]: moved class XformColor here.
	Also moved FormPreferences::browseFile here as it can be used by any
	xform dialog with a "Browse" button. FormGraphics is a perfect example.

	* src/support/filetools.[Ch] (WriteableDir, ReadableDir, WriteableFile,
	ReadableFile): changed the FormPreferences methods a little and moved
	them here as they'll be useful elsewhere also.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.h: a bit more cleaning up.
	Removed some header files and used forward declarations instead.
	Better commenting.
	Removed some methods as they'll be useful elsewhere (see above).

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: a bit more cleaning up.
	Can also now modify the LyX LColors. However, for reasons that I don't
	yet understand, it appears that we can use
	LyXFunc::Dispatch(LFUN_SET_COLOR, arg) only when we have a buffer
	present. The problem appears to lie in ColorHandler, because I can
	change the color using LColor.SetColor(). Similarly, when reading in a
	preferences file with some set_color instances, I'll get a warning
	like: Color sea green is undefined or may not be redefined 
	Bad lyxrc set_color for sea green

	Once the buffer is loaded, however, I can happily change to this color.

	Finally, it appears that I have to set the color of "inset frame"
	explicitly, or it oscillates from "black" to "indian red" with each
	successive "Apply".
                                           
2000-11-15  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* ANNOUNCE: corrected a spelling mistake.
	
	* src/tabular.C (OldFormatRead): variable "h" was set but never used.
	Removed.

2000-11-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/kbsequence.C (addkey): use a vector as per Andre Poenitz patch.

	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): also delete doc/.cvsignore from
	distdir. 

	* src/support/lyxfunctional.h: make back_insert_fun_iterator(s)
	match the requirements from the standard better. This is required
	to work with gnu libstdc++-v3

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: add explict pair
	arguments to browse calls. include support/lyxmanip.h remvoe
	extern fmt. whitespace changes. reorder variables in
	FormPreferences.h, to match initalizaton order.

	* several files: constify more local variables.
	
	* src/buffer.C: remove some commented functions.

	* src/DepTable.C (remove_files_with_extension): temporary
	work around for gcc 2.97 
	* src/filedlg.C (find): ditto
	* src/Variables.C (set): ditto
	* src/LyXAction.C (searchActionArg): ditto
	(retrieveActionArg): ditto

	* configure.in: check for mktemp too

	* UPGRADING: prepare for 1.1.6

	* Makefile.am (lgbtags): add backup tags for when etags are
	different than usual.

	* ANNOUNCE: prepare for 1.1.6

	* src/support/tempname.C (make_tempfile): new function, wrapper
	around mkstemp and mktemp. Only mkstemp has been tested.
	(tempName): call it.
	
2000-11-14  Rob Lahaye  <lahaye@postech.edu>
	
	* default.ui: capitalized some menu items to improve shortcuts.

2000-11-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C (ok): use AddName().

	* src/frontends/xforms/Dialogs.C: add "using" directive.

2000-11-13  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/filedlg.C (Select): highlight suggested file in browser, if
	it is present.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]: re-written so that
	each tab folder is encapsulated in its own class.
	The Language keymaps are now chosen using a text input and a
	browser button, rather than a Combox.
	All the browser buttons are now functional, although LyXFileDlg
	still needs to be modified to make it straighhtforward to return a
	directory if that is what is desired.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: use text input
	and browse button to input the Language keymaps. Add a few
	callbacks for the browse buttons.

2000-11-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/tempname.C (tempName): small changes to make it
	safer. remove the '.' before XXXXXX

	* src/support/filetools.C (TmpFileName): remove func 
	(GetCWD): ditto
	
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormRef.C (FormRef): explicit call the bp

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormTabularCreate.C (FormTabularCreate): ditto
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormTabular.C (FormTabular): ditto

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormInset.h (FormInset): remove default for bp
	(FormCommand): ditto
	
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormGraphics.C (FormGraphics): explicit
	call the bp

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormError.C (FormError): use IgnorantPolicy
	for bp (this fixes a reproducible hard crash)

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.C (FormCopyright): explicit
	call the bp

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.h: make bp_ private
	(FormBaseBI): remove default for bp
	(FormBaseBD): ditto
	
	* src/frontends/xforms/Dialogs.C (Dialogs): use the old method it
	is safe enough.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.C (RGBColor): made several vars
	const, changed initialization of j to allow it to be const
	(HSVColor): similar

	* several files: added const to local variables.
	
	* src/lyx_cb.C: removed several function prototypes and moved them
	to lyx_cb.h
	(MenuWrite):
	(MenuWriteAs):
	(UpdateLayoutPreamble): 
	(MenuLayoutSave): 
	(MenuInsertLabel): add BufferView as arguemnt
	(LayoutsCB): make tmp const

	* src/layout_forms.h: regenerated

	* src/debug.C: add Debug::FILES
	(showLevel) (showTags): translate the desc

	* src/debug.h: add FILES as debug target

	* src/bufferlist.C: use current_view as an interim measure becuase
	of added arguments to MenuWrite and MenuWriteAs

	* forms/layout_forms.h.patch: make the patch more correct and more appalyable

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_STD_COUNT): change test to not involve
	string. 
	(LYX_PROG_CXX): change 2.97 rules to include the -f.. that
	libstdc++ is compiled with.

2000-11-13  José Abílio Matos <jamatos@fep.up.pt>
	
	* lib/layouts/docbook-book.layout
	* lib/layouts/docbook.layout
	* lib/layouts/linuxdoc.layout: No need for "dummy" paragraphs, now
	those paragraphs are expresse as SGML comments <!-- -->.

	* src/LaTeXFeatures.h
	* src/LaTeXFeatures.C (getIncludedFiles): takes a filename as 
	parameter, this allows to express all the include files as relative
	paths to the master buffer. The verbatim insert works as the other
	include file modes.

	* src/buffer.C (sgmlOpenTag) (sgmlCloseTag): don't write if latexname
	is a SGML comment.
	(MakeLinuxdocFile) (MakeDocBookFile): included files are relative 
	to master path.
	(MakeDocBookFile): top_element is always written. Some clean up, as
	sgmlOpenTag() and sgmlCloseTag() take care of the SGML comment case.

	* src/insets/insetinclude.C (Linuxdoc): Added verbatim file fix.
	(DocBook) added close tag to inlinegraphics trick for verbatim. Now
	a reference is written instead of the name.
	(Validate): use the relative path for the filename.

	* src/insets/insetlabel.C (DocBook): write end tag, for XML
	compatibility. 

	* src/support/filetools.h
	* src/support/filetools.C (IsSGMLFilename): added.
	(BasePath): added.

2000-11-13  Miyata Shigeru  <miyata@kusm.kyoto-u.ac.jp>

	* development/OS2/quick_fix.patch: 
	* lib/configure.cmd: 
	* README.OS2: quick update to the OS/2 port.

2000-11-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/converter.C: add "using" directive.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: add "using" directive.
	(compare_converter): add "int" as return type.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.C: comment out FL_LIGHTER_COL1 here
	too. 

2000-11-11  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): map the xform colours, should a
	mapping exist. Ie, call XformColor::read().

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.[Ch] renamed struct RGB as RGBColor
	and struct HSV as HSVColor.	
	(XformColor::read, XformColor::write) : new methods that
	input/output any changes to the cform GUI colors.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Dialogs.C: FORMS_H_LOCATION no longer
	included.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C Lots of little changes
	associated with the changed name of the RGB and HSV structs. Can
	now save changes to xforms GUI to file. Commented out
	FL_LIGHTER_COL1 to allow compilation with xforms 0.88. It isn't
	used currently anyway.

2000-11-11  Dekel Tsur  <dekelts@tau.ac.il>

	* src/converter.C: A lot of changes:
	- It is no longer possible to choose between two or more ways to 
	export to some format (the new code uses only the shortest path).
	However, it is still possible to choose between pdflatex/ps2pdf
	for  creating a PDF file, by defining two PDF formats: pdf & pdf2.
	- Added several methods that makes  the FormPreferences code simpler.
	- Changed the tokens $$FName and $$OutName to $$i and $$o.

	* src/exporter.C (Export): lyxrc.use_pdf is set before
	makeLaTeXFile is called. This works but not very nice.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: The formats/converters
	tabs are now fully functional.

	* src/buffer.C (getTocList): Add numbers to the captions. 

	* lib/lyxrc.example: Removed fax section

	* src/support/rename.C (rename): Delete the old file if lyx::copy
	is called.

2000-11-13  Rob Lahaye <lahaye@postech.edu>

	* lib/ui/default.ui: minor polishing.

2000-11-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.C: include <algorithm> and <cmath>
	headers. 

	* lib/Makefile.am (DOCINST): do not install everything in the
	documentation directory.

2000-11-10  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* src/bufferlist.C (newFile): set the filename to the constructed
	newfileXX.lyx

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuWriteAs): if a buffer is "unnamed", pass the
	constructed "newfileXX.lyx" name to the dialog

	* src/frontends/DialogBase.h: make update() non-abstract so
	KDE doesn't need to implement two update methods for every form

	* src/frontends/kde/Makefile.am: add missing xforms objects
	to compile again

	* src/frontends/kde/Dialogs.C: Add FormTabularCreate dialog

2000-11-09  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/xforms/Color.[Ch]: new files, defining the color
	structs RGB and HSV. May not be the best place for these files.
	Perhaps move them into src ?

	* src/frontends/xforms/Makefile.am: added new files.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]: bowed to reality and
	replaced all instances of "colour" with "color"!

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: modified Colors tab
	slightly yet again.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]: functioning Colors
	tab. Can now alter the colors of the xform's GUI on the fly. With
	the aid of a single static Signal (see below), can "Apply" these
	changes to all currently open dialogs. (Well, to all of the NEW
	dialogs and to LyXView. The OLD dialogs are not yet redrawn.) ALL
	subsequently opened dialogs will, of course, also have the new
	color scheme. Cannot yet save (or load) the choices to file, so
	they are lost when exiting LyX.
	
	* src/frontends/Dialogs.h:
	* src/frontends/xforms/Dialogs.C (redrawGUI): new static Signal.
	Used to trigger a redraw of any dialogs connected to it because,
	for example, the GUI colours have been re-mapped.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormParagraph.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormTabular.[Ch]: (redraw): new virtual
	method, to be connected to Dialogs::redrawGUI. Method must be
	virtual, because dialogs with tabbed folders need to redraw the
	forms of each tab folder.

	* src/LyXView.C (d-tor):
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.C (d-tor): connected
	Dialogs::redrawGUI signal to redraw().

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.C (~FormBaseBI, ~FormBaseBD):
	removed Assert, because it is identical to that in FormBase.

2000-11-10  Rob Lahaye <lahaye@postech.edu>

	* lib/ui/default.ui: minor polishing.

2000-11-10  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (resizeLyXText): check !cache[bv]
	(deleteLyXText): ditto

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (InsetButtonPress): don't clear the
	selection on mouse-button-3.

	* src/insets/insettabular.h: new function clearSelection(), use this
	functions inside insettabular.C.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (TabularFeatures): clear the selection
	on remove_row/column.

	* src/insets/inset.C (scroll): fixed some scroll stuff.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (draw): fixed another minor draw problem.

2000-11-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/CREDITS: add Yves Bastide

2000-11-03  Yves Bastide  <stid@libd-pc11.univ-bpclermont.fr>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_GLOBAL_CSTD): new function to
	check whether C library functions are in the global namespace.

	* configure.in: calls it.

	* src/support/lstrings.C: #ifndef CXX_GLOBAL_CSTD instead of
	#ifndef __GLIBCPP__.

2000-11-08  Dekel Tsur  <dekelts@tau.ac.il>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C (updateLanguage): Check
	iterators to prevent crash.

2000-11-08  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/converter.h (getprettyname, getFromToPrettyname): new methods.

	* src/frontends/xforms/xform_macros.h (C_PREPOSTHANDLER): new macro
	shortcut for xforms CB to the preemptive or post-handler function.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd (form_preferences):
	removed the HIDDEN_TIMER as it's no longer used.
	Various other small changes.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]: removed timer. Use a
	preemptive handler to obtain feedback, rather than the post-handler.
	(ColoursLoadBrowser): find "black" and "white" based on RGB values
	rather than name.
	Formats tab is now complete. Converters tab is nearly so.

2000-11-09  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (~InsetText): 
	(clear): 
	(Read):

	* src/frontends/ButtonPolicies.C: ditto.

	* src/support/filetools.C (DirList): add an explicit cast to avoid
	a compile error (probably not the right fix)

2000-11-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.C (DirList): implement using system functions

	* src/support/tempname.C: new file

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_la_SOURCES): add tempname.C

	* src/insets/insetexternal.C (InsetExternal): use lyx::tempName

	* src/graphics/GraphicsCacheItem_pimpl.C (renderXPM): use
	lyx::tempName

	* src/converter.[Ch] (GetAllCommands): new method.

	* src/support/filetools.[Ch] (DirList): new method.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C: started (just!) adding
	functionality to the converters tab.
	The formats tab is now nearly complete.
	The kbmap choices in Languages tab now display the contents of
	system_lyxdir/kbd/*.kmap in readable form.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.h: made struct RGB private.
	Moved some variables into the class.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: Revert colour of
	inactive tab folder to FL_COL1. Haven't yet worked out how to change
	colour of active folder to lighter grey instead. Any takers?
	(form_colours): added an "Apply" button.
	(form_converters): added a "Flags" input field.
	(form_formats): added a "Shortcut" input field. Note that we can't use
	names such as "input_shortcut" as this buggers up the sed script stuff.

2000-11-07  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/LaTeXLog.C:
	* src/LyXSendto.C:
	* src/credits.C:
	* src/filedlg.C:
	* src/intl.C:
	* src/lyx_cb.C:
	* src/lyx_sendfax_main.C:
	* src/lyxfr0.C:
	* src/lyxvc.C:
	* src/spellchecker.C:
	* src/insets/figinset.C:
	* src/insets/insetbib.C:
	* src/insets/insetexternal.C:
	* src/insets/insetinclude.C:
	* src/insets/insetinfo.C:
	* src/mathed/math_panel.C:
	use FL_PLACE_MOUSE | FL_FREE_SIZE, FL_TRANSIENT in fl_show_form(), so
	all "daughter" dialogs now have identical "feel".
                                
2000-11-07  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.[Ch] (IgnoreCloseBoxCB): removed as it's no longer
	used (and was only used in one place prior to this patch. Incorrectly!)

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.C: changed some instances of
	FL_RETURN_ALWAYS to FL_RETURN_CHANGED as I think that this makes more
	sense. Also added fl_set_input_return() for class_->input_doc_extra and
	for options_->input_float_placement. This fixes a bug reported by
	Rob Lahaye.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormGraphics.[Ch] (free): removed. Placed
	functionality into d-tor.

	* src/frontends/xforms/input_validators.c (fl_lowercase_filter): allow
	input of numerals also.

	fl_set_form_atclose(). Can now close dialog from window manager,
	fixing a bug reported by Rob Lahaye.

2000-11-06  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: Inactive tab folders
	are no longer dark. Haven't yet worked out how to lighten the colour of
	the active tabfolder. Any ideas anybody?
	Adjusted Colours tab a little.
	Added Shortcut field to converters tab. Note that we can't create an
	fdesign label like "input_shortcut" as this buggers up the sed-script
	stuff.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]:
	(feedback): fixed crash due to to ob=0.
	(LanguagesXXX): the kbmap choices now contain the files
	sytem_lyxdir/kbd/*.kmap. I think that these choices should eventually
	be replaced by an input with a file browse button, but since the browse
	buttons don'y yet work, this'll do for the moment.
	(FormatsXXX): think that this is now nearly fully functional.
	Some points/questions though:
	1. Does "Apply" remove formats if no longer present?
	2. I think that the browser should list the GUI names rather than the
	   format names.
	3. Must ensure that we can't delete Formats used by an existing
	   Converter.

	* src/support/filetools.[Ch] (DirList): new function. Not at all sure
	if this is the best way to do this.

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): add new entry LFUN_FLOATSOPERATE, name
	"floats-operate". The name is ugly (and the func also), but this
	is just a band-aid until we switch to new insets.

2000-11-03  Rob Lahaye  <lahaye@postech.edu>

	* lib/ui/default.ui: update again the menu layout (fix some

	* src/frontends/DialogBase.h: revert to original definition of
	update(). 
	
	* src/frontends/xforms/Dialogs.C (c-tor): splitting the tabular

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormXXX.[Ch] (update): revert to original
	definition.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch] (FormBaseBD::updateSlot): new
	method. Continues Allan's idea, but means that derived classes
	don't need to worry about "update or hide?".

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormError.C (showInset): add connection
	again ;-) 

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormTabular.[Ch]: split into two classes,
	one for each dialog. FormTabular now contains main tabular dialog
	only.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormTabularCreate.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_tabular_create.fd: the create
	dialog. 

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormGraphics.[Ch]:

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/makefile: added new files.

	* src/insets/insettabular.[Ch]: removed (Dialogs *) member
	variable. added Signal0 hide signal, in keeping with other GUI-I
	insets.

	it's already declared in Lsstream.h.

2000-10-23  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/figinset.C (GhostscriptMsg): use DisplayString() to
	open a new display.
	(runqueue): ditto.

2000-10-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

2000-10-19  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormXXX.[Ch] where XXX is a FormBase daughter:
	read the xforms manual to discover that fl_set_form_minsize()/maxsize()
	work only for the next call to fl_show_form(). The correct place to set
	them, therefore is in connect() immediately BEFORE fl_show_form(). Now
	done. FormBase also stores minw_, minh_ itself. All dialogs derived
	from FormBase have the minimum size set; no more stupid crashes with
	tabbed folders etc.

	compiling, but I don't like this!

2000-10-18  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/text2.C (ClearSelection): if we clear the selection we need
	more refresh so set the status apropriately

	consistent with LyXCursor::pos().
	(inset_pos): changed to LyXParagraph::size_type for same reason.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (resizeLyXText): changed some temporary
	variables refing to cursor position to LyXParagraph::size_type.

	* src/buffer.C (setReadonly):
	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (buffer): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormCopyright.h (update): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormCitation.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormIndex.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormPrint.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormRef.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormToc.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/kde/FormUrl.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormCopyright.h (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormCitation.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormError.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormIndex.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormPrint.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormRef.h (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormToc.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/gnome/FormUrl.[Ch] (update): 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormGraphics.[Ch] (update): reflect new changes
	to updateBufferDependent and DialogBase

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCitation.[hC]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.[hC]: also removed restore()
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormError.[Ch]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormGraphics.[Ch]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormIndex.[Ch]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormParagraph.[Ch]: also added missing "virtual"s
	and fixed readOnly handling.
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.[Ch]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormRef.[Ch]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormTabular.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormToc.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormUrl.[Ch]: 
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormInset.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[hC]: modifications to use the new
	form of updateBufferDependent.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.C (hide): only call disconnect()
	if form()->visible just in case someone does stuff to the form in a
	derived class.

	* src/frontends/DialogBase.h (enum): removed enum since we can now use
	the buttoncontroller for everything the enum used to be used for.
	(update) It would seem we need to force all dialogs to use a bool
	parameter or have two update functions.  I chose to go with one.
	I did try removing update() from here and FormBase and defining the
	appropriate update signatures in FormBaseB[DI] but then ran into the
	problem of the update() call in FormBase::show().  Whatever I did
	to get around that would require another function and that just
	got more confusing.  Hence the decision to make everyone have an
	update(bool). An alternative might have been to override show() in
	FormBaseB[DI] and that would allow the different and appropriate
	update signatures. 

	* src/frontends/Dialogs.h (updateBufferDependent): now takes a bool.
	true == buffer change occurred.  I decided against using a default
	template parameter since not all compilers support that at present.

2000-10-11  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch] (FormBase) : made less of a "swiss
	army knife" by removing functionality.
	(clearStore): removed. All such housekeeping on hide()ing the dialog
	is to be carried out by overloaded disconnect() methods.
	(dialogIsOpen): removed. Relevant only to Inset dialogs anyway, but
	superceded by Baruch's neat test (FormGraphics) to update an existing
	dialog if a new signal is recieved rather than block all new signals
	until it is closed.
	(cba_, parent_, updateOrHide): removed to new FormInset class. Relevant
	only to Inset dialogs.
	(FormBaseBI, FormBaseBD): new classes derived from FormBase for
	"Buffer Independent" and "Buffer Dependent" dialogs respectively.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCommand.[Ch]: renamed as FormInset.[Ch]

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormInset.[Ch] (FormInset): New class, defined
	as a base class to all inset dialogs. Used solely to connect/disconnect
	the Inset::hide signal and to define what action to take on receipt of
	a UpdateBufferDependent signal.
	(FormCommand): now derived from FormInset.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCitation.[Ch] (clearStore): reworked as
	disconnect().

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]:
	now derived from FormBaseBI.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormParagraph.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.[Ch]:

	* src/lyxrc.[Ch]: commented out noncopyable so I can keep a
	system_lyxrc. 
	I'll rewrite this later, after 1.1.6 probably, to keep a single
	LyXRC but two instances of a LyXRCStruct.

2000-10-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insetinclude.[Ch]:
	* src/insets/insetparent.[Ch]:
	* src/insets/insetref.[Ch]:
	* src/insets/insettabular.[Ch] (c-tor): Buffer passed as const &.

	* src/insets/*.[Ch]:
	* src/mathed/formula.[Ch]:
	* src/mathed/formulamacro.C (Clone): passed Buffer const &.

	* src/buffer.C (parseSingleLyXformat2Token, readInset):
	* src/lyx_cb.C (FigureApplyCB):

	big enough already!

2000-10-09  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/text.C (GetRow): small fix.

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (cursorPrevious): 
	(cursorNext): added LyXText parameter to function.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (LocalDispatch): activate cell inset on
	keypress depending on cursor position.

2000-10-06  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (Ascii): finally call right ascii-function.
	(copySelection): redone this function and also copy ascii representa-
	tion to clipboard.

	* src/tabular.C (Ascii): 
	(AsciiPrintCell): 
	(AsciiBottomHLine): 
	(AsciiTopHLine): 
	(print_n_chars): new functions to realize the ascii export of tabulars.

2000-10-05  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C (updateAllVisibleBufferRelatedDialogs): small fix
	if we don't have a buffer.

2000-10-10  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch] (hide): Fix the problem
	with closing dialog.  It seems that nested tabfolders require hiding
	of inner tabfolders before hiding the dialog itself.  Actually all I
	did was hide the active outer folder.

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (buffer): don't call updateBufferDependent
	unless there really is a buffer.  hideBufferDependent is called
	instead.

	* po/Makefile.in.in (POTFILES.in): one little tweak to ensure
	POTFILES.in stays in $(srcdir).

2000-10-09  Dekel Tsur  <dekelts@tau.ac.il>

	* lib/lyxrc.example: Few changes.

2000-10-05  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (buffer): only need one the
	updateBufferDependent signal to be emitted once! Moved to the end of
	the method to allow bv_->text to be updated first.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch]: replaced the two signals uSignal_
	and hSignal_ with Dialogs * and BufferDependency variables.
	New Buffer * parent_, initialised when the dialog is launched. Used to
	check whether to update() or hide() dialog in the new, private
	updateOrHide() method that is connected to the updateBufferDependent
	signal. Daughter classes dictate what to do using the
	ChangedBufferAction enum, passed to the c-tor.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCitation.C:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCommand.C:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.C:

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormRef.C:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormToc.C:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormUrl.C (c-tor): modified call to FormBase
	c-tor.

	ChangedBufferAction enum.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormParagraph.[Ch]
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_paragraph.fd: now derived from
	FormBase.
	
2000-10-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/bind/cua.bind: fix a bit.
	* lib/bind/emacs.bind: ditto.

	* lib/bind/menus.bind: remove real menu entries from there.

	* src/spellchecker.C: make sure we only include strings.h when
	_AIX is defined.	

2000-10-05  Dekel Tsur  <dekelts@tau.ac.il>

	* src/frontends/xforms/Menubar_pimpl.C (get_new_submenu): New
	function. It enlarges the maximum number of pup when needed.
	(add_toc2): Open a new menu if maximum number of items per menu has 
	reached.
	
2000-10-05  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/kde/FormPrint.C: fix error reporting

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.C: fix compiler
	warnings

	* lib/.cvsignore: add Literate.nw

2000-10-05  Dekel Tsur  <dekelts@tau.ac.il>

	* buffer.C
	* bufferview_funcs.[Ch]
	* lyxfont.[Ch]
	* text.C
	* text2.C: Add support for numbers in RTL text.

2000-10-06  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* po/Makefile.in.in (POTFILES.in, POTFILES): Fixed
	to be gettext.m4 friendly again.  ext_l10n.h is now
	generated into $top_srcdir instead of $top_builddir
	so that lyx.pot will be built correctly -- without
	duplicate parsing of ext_l10n.h.

2000-10-04  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* src/frontends/kde/FormCitation.C: make the dialog
	behave more sensibly

2000-10-03  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* config/kde.m4: fix consecutive ./configure runs,
	look for qtarch, fix library order

	* src/frontends/kde/Makefile.am: tidy up,
	add Print dialog, add .dlg dependencies

	* src/frontends/kde/FormPrint.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/FormPrint.h:
	* src/frontends/kde/formprintdialog.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/formprintdialog.h:
	* src/frontends/kde/formprintdialogdata.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/formprintdialogdata.h:
	* src/frontends/kde/dlg/formprintdialog.dlg: add
	print dialog

	* src/frontends/kde/dlg/README: Added explanatory readme
	
	* src/frontends/kde/dlg/checkinitorder.pl: small perl
	script to double-check qtarch's output

	* src/frontends/kde/formindexdialog.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/formindexdialogdata.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/formindexdialogdata.h:
	* src/frontends/kde/dlg/formindexdialog.dlg: update
	for qtarch, minor fixes

2000-10-05  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (buffer): don't hide all buffer dependent
	dialogs when switching buffers update them instead.  It's up to each
	dialog to decide if it should still be visible or not.
	update() should return a bool to control visiblity within show().
	Or perhaps better to set a member variable and use that to control
	visibility.

	* lib/build-listerrors: create an empty "listerrors" file just to stop
	make trying to regenerate it all the time if you don't have noweb
	installed.

	* .cvsignore: ignore distdir and dist.tar.gz using rule lyx-*

	* po/Makefile.in.in (ext_l10n.h): added a rule to build
	$(top_builddir)/src/ext_l10n.h.  The rule has to go here because po/
	is built before src/ and ext_l10n.h isn't actually needed to build lyx.
	(POTFILES.in): added a rule to build POTFILES.in.  It is also now safe
	to rebuild POTFILES.in with scrap *.[hC] files in xforms/forms/.

	* autogen.sh: po/POTFILES.in and src/ext_l10n.h now generated by make.

2000-10-04  Angus Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk>

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (buffer): emit hideBufferDependent when
	deleting buffer. Closes all buffer-dependent dialogs.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.[Ch] (input): modified to pass
	FL_OBJECT * also.
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCitation.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormRef.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormUrl.[Ch]: ditto

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.[Ch]:
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_document.C.patch:
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_document.fd: all input callbacks now
	pass through a single input() function.

2000-10-04  John Levon  <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk>

	* lib/build-listerrors: return status as OK

2000-10-04  Dekel Tsur  <dekelts@tau.ac.il>

	LexAlpha. 

	* src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): add '@' as an LM_TC_VAR
	character. 

	* lib/layouts/amsart.layout: include lyxmacros.inc, so that
	LyX-Code is defined.
	* lib/layouts/amsbook.layout: ditto.

	* boost/Makefile.am: fix typo. 

	* src/frontends/xforms/Menubar_pimpl.C (create_submenu): use
	Menu::expand. 
	(add_lastfiles): removed.
	(add_documents): removed.
	(add_formats): removed.

	* src/frontends/Menubar.C: remove useless "using" directive.

	* src/MenuBackend.h: add a new MenuItem constructor.

	* src/MenuBackend.[Ch] (Menu::expand): new method. Used in the
	xforms frontend.

2000-10-04  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (listerrors):
	* lib/build-listerrors: make $builddir != $srcdir compiles work again.
	I haven't got notangle installed so Kayvan please test. The output
	should end up in $builddir.  This also allows people who don't have
	noweb installed to complete the make process without error.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCommand.[Ch] (showInset):
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormError.[Ch] (showInset): fix warnings found

	* src/mathed/formula.C (IsMacro): declared but not referenced; removed.
	* src/mathed/math_cursor.C (IsAlpha): ditto.
	* src/mathed/math_inset.C (strnew): ditto.

	using the Buffer * passed to Latex(), using the BufferView * passed to
	bibitemMaxWidth() bibitemWidest() and by passing a Buffer* to getKeys()

	* src/insets/insetinclude.C: use the Buffer * passed to Latex(),
	Linuxdoc() and DocBook() rather than the stored Buffer * master.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): used new InsetBibtex c-tor

	the top of the function, because compaq cxx complains that the
	"goto exit_with_message" when the function is disabled bypasses
	its initialization.
	(MenuNew): try a better fix for the generation of new file names.
	This time, I used AddName() instead of AddPath(), hoping Juergen
	will be happier :)

2000-10-03  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch]: redesign of dialog using
	nested tabfolders has begun.  The old "Miscellaneous" was renamed as
	"Look and Feel"->"General" but will need to be split up further into
	general output and general input tabs.  Current plan is for four outer
	tabfolders: "Look and Feel" for colours, bindings, fonts and other HCI
	stuff; "Inputs" for input and import configuration; "Outputs" for
	output and export configuration; and one more whatever is left over
	called "General".  The leftovers at present look like being which
	viewers to use, spellchecker, language support and might be better
	named "Support".  I've put "Paths" in "Inputs" for the moment as this
	seems reasonable for now at least.
	One problem remains: X error kills LyX when you close Preferences.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.[Ch] (restore): D'oh.
	Left this one out by accident.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormBase.h (restore): default to calling
	update() since that will restore the original/currently-applied values.
	Any input() triggered error messages will require the derived classes
	to redefine restore().

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormDocument.C: initialize a few variables to
	avoid a segfault.  combo_doc_class is the main concern.

2000-10-01  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@camel.internal.sylvan.com>

2000-09-28  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): fixed output of '\n'.  The problem was
	that the #ifdef's had been applied to part of what should have been
	a complete condition.  It's possible there are other tests that
	were specific to tables that are also wrong now that InsetTabular is
	being used. Now we need to fix the output of '\n' after a table in a
	float for the same reason as the original condition:
	"don't insert this if we would be adding it before or after a table
	in a float.  This little trick is needed in order to allow use of
	tables in \subfigures or \subtables."
	Juergen can you check this?

2000-09-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	the one should have red ears by now!

	* src/insets/insettext.C (LocalDispatch): fixed setting of same layouts
	in more then one paragraph. Fixed cursor-movement/selection.

	rather than Dialogs *. Also defined an enum to ease use. All xforms
	forms can now be derived from this class.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCommand.[Ch]
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.[Ch]: now derived from FormBase.

	not have namespaces.

	calls (fixes some memory leaks)

2000-07-28  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.C (build): Setup input return
	checking.  NOTE: It seems that pressing ESC to cancel the dialog also
	triggers the callback for input checking. As a result we sometimes get
	"LyX: This shouldn't happen..." printed to cerr.
	(input): Started using status variable since I only free() on 
	destruction.  Some input checking for paths and font sizes.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPreferences.h: Use status to control 
	activation of Ok and Apply

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_preferences.fd: Setup input return
	callback.  Also resized to stop segfaults with 0.88.  The problem is
	that xforms-0.88 requires the folder to be wide enough to fit all the
	tabs.  If it isn't it causes all sorts of problems.

	User can now resize dialog in the x-direction.
	Resizing the dialog in the y-direction is prevented, as the
	code does this intelligently already.

2000-06-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* INSTALL: remove obsolete entry in "problems" section.

	* lib/examples/sl_*.lyx: update of the slovenian examples.

	unlocking inset in inset.

2000-06-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/lyxscreen.h: added some y_offset/x_offset parameters for drawings
	of insets and moved first to LyXText.

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.[Ch]:
	* src/mathed/formula.[Ch]: changed prototype of draw() and GetCursorPos

2000-06-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/text.C (GetVisibleRow): look if I should clear the area or not
	using Inset::doClearArea() function.

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: added doClearArea() function and
	modified draw(Painter &, ...) to draw(BufferView *, ...)

	* src/text2.C (UpdateInset): return bool insted of int

2000-06-20  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): Add "Reset" option to the language 
	combox in the character popup

	* src/lyx_cb.C (UserFreeFont): Add argument to the method:
	BufferParams const & params

2000-06-20  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (SetParagraphData): set insetowner on
	2- paragraphs.

2000-06-21  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/Timeout.[Ch]: Change to use signals instead of callbacks.
	* src/LyXView.h (struct FD_form_main): remove, LyXView inherits
	from SigC::Object
	(form_main_): remove
	
	* src/LyXView.C (LyXView_AutosaveTimerCB): remove 
	(create_form_form_main): remove FD_form_main stuff, connect to
	autosave_timeout signal

	* src/LyXView.[Ch] (getMainForm): remove 
	(UpdateTimerCB): remove
	* src/BufferView_pimpl.h: inherit from SigC::Object

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C (Pimpl): connect to cursor_timeout with
	signal instead of callback

	* src/BufferView.[Ch] (cursorToggleCB): remove 

2000-06-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/BufferView_pimpl.C: changes because of the one below

	* src/screen.[Ch]: Made the lyxscreen take LyXText as argument
	instead of storing a pointer to a LyXText. 

	* src/buffer.[Ch]: apply Baruch's remove isdviclean patch. 

2000-06-10  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/lyxparagraph.h

	* src/paragraph.C: Changed fontlist to a sorted vector.

2000-06-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/BufferView.h: added screen() function.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (LocalDispatch): some selection code
	fixed.

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): use stringfunctions instead of sscanf.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (SetParagraphData):
	(Read): 
	(InsetText):  fixes for multiple paragraphs.

2000-06-17  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@sylvan.com>

	* development/lyx.spec.in: Call configure with ``--without-warnings''
	to work around a bug with the Makefiles when doing ``make lyxrpm''.
	This should be fine, however, since we generally don't want to be
	verbose when making an RPM.
	
2000-06-16  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* lib/scripts/fig2pstex.py: New file

2000-06-16  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (UpdateLocal): 
	* src/insets/insettext.C (UpdateLocal): fixed mark_dirty problem.
	(LocalDispatch): Changed all functions to use LyXText.

2000-06-15  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/text.C (SetHeightOfRow): call inset::update before requesting
	any width/height.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (update): 
	* src/insets/insettabular.C (update): added implementation

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: added update function

2000-06-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C (SelectNextWord): protect against null pointers with
	old-style string streams. (fix from Paul Theo Gonciari
	<gptheo@yahoo.com>) 

	* src/cite.[Ch]: remove erroneous files.

	* lib/configure.m4: update the list of created directories.

	* src/lyxrow.C: include <config.h>
	* src/lyxcursor.C: ditto.

2000-06-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/examples/decimal.lyx: new example file from Mike.

	* src/insets/ExternalTemplate.C (readTemplates): Use LibFileSearch()
	to find template definitions (from Dekel)

	* src/frontends/.cvsignore: add a few things.

	* src/frontends/xforms/input_validators.[ch]: remove C++ comments.

	* src/Timeout.C (TimeOut): remove default argument.

	* src/LyXView.C (LyXView_AutosaveTimerCB): this should not have
	"C" linkage.

	* src/insets/ExternalTemplate.C: add a "using" directive.

	* src/lyx_main.h: remove the act_ struct, which seems unused
	anyway. 

2000-06-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* LyX Developers Meeting: All files changed, due to random C++ (by
	coincidence) code generator script.

	- external inset (cool!)
	- initial online editing of preferences
	- insettabular breaks insettext(s contents)
	- cleanup
	- some DocBook fixes
	- example files update
	- other cool stuff, create a diff and look for yourself.

2000-06-09  The Great LyX Application  <lyx@localhost.localdomain>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): if the maxWidth is
	-1 this is a non-line-breaking textinset.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (GetMaxWidthOfCell): returns now -1
	if there is no width set.

2000-06-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Lots of files: Merged the dialogbase branch.

2000-06-09  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/xtl/, src/lyxfunc.[Ch], src/buffer.[Ch]:  Removed XTL and
	and the Dispatch methods that used it.

	* src/frontends/Liason.[Ch]: replaced with a Liason namespace for 
	access to functions formerly kept in Dispatch.

2000-05-19  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/PrinterParams.h, src/buffer.C, src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.C:
	made to_page and count_copies integers again.  from_page remains a
	string however because I want to allow entry of a print range like
	"1,4,22-25" using this field.

	* src/LyXAction.C: added action info and commands for buffer-print-xtl
	and printer-params-get.  These aren't useful from the minibuffer but
	could be used by a script/LyXServer app provided it passes a suitable
	auto_mem_buffer.  I guess I should take a look at how the LyXServer
	works and make it support xtl buffers.

	* sigc++/: updated to libsigc++-1.0.1

	* src/xtl/: updated to xtl-1.3.pl.11

	* forms/makefile, forms/fdfix.sh, forms/layout_forms.fd: Made sure
	those changes done to the files in src/ are actually recreated when
	they  get regenerated. Please don't ever accept a patch that changes a
	dialog unless that patch includes the changes to the corresponding *.fd
	file.

	* src/lyx_cb.C, src/support/lstrings.[hC]: Moved Stephen Witt's
	stringOnlyContains, renamed it and generalised it.

	* lots-of-files: Rolled the "rae" branch over into the "dialogbase"
	branch.  Removed the remaining old form_print code.

2000-04-26  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* ChangeLog, development/tools/lxtl.sh: D'oh! Got caught in the same
	trap I was trying to fix with the ID: fields in src/xtl/  :-)

2000-04-25  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/xtl/: Updated to incorporate Angus's two patches as well as mine
	against a base of xtl-1.3.pl.4

	* development/tools/lxtl.sh: fixed a couple of silly typos and now
	filter the Id: entries so they still show the xtl version number
	they are based on.

	* src/support/lxtl.h: removed auto_mem_buffer which is now incorporated
	into the src/xtl code.  Patch still pending with José (XTL)

2000-04-24  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxfunc.[Ch] (Dispatch): Use a mem buffer as a parameter. This is
	both more generic and much safer. Use the new template functions.
	* src/buffer.[Ch] (Dispatch): ditto.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.C (update): Use new template functions
	and mem buffer more intelligently. Also a little general cleanup.
	(apply): ditto.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Extra stuff for xtl that I forgot.
	* development/tools/lxtl.sh: Ditto.  Makefile.am + .cvsignore
	* src/xtl/Makefile.am: ditto.
	* src/xtl/.cvsignore: ditto.
	* src/Makefile.am: ditto.

	* src/PrinterParams.h: Removed the macros member functions. Added a
	testInvariant member function.  A bit of tidying up and commenting.
	Included Angus's idea for fixing operation with egcs-1.1.2.

	* src/support/lxtl.h: Many changes.  Added auto_mem_buffer -- a really
	cool expansion of XTL's mem_buffer to support automatic memory
	management within the buffer itself.  Removed the various macros and
	replaced them with template functions that use either auto_mem_buffer
	or mem_buffer depending on a #define.  The mem_buffer support will
	disappear as soon as the auto_mem_buffer is confirmed to be good on
	other platforms/compilers.  That is, it's there so you've got something
	to compare against.

	* src/xtl/objio.h: Changes to support auto_mem_buffer.  This has
	effectively forked XTL.  However I expect José will include my code
	into the next major release.  Also fixed a memory leak.
	* src/xtl/text.h: ditto.
	* src/xtl/xdr.h: ditto.
	* src/xtl/giop.h: ditto.

2000-04-16  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* acinclude.m4, sigc++/acinclude.m4:  Removed -- they're generated
	by autogen.sh and removed by maintainer-clean anyway.
	* .cvsignore, sigc++/.cvsignore:  Support the above.

	* sigc++/.cvsignore: Forgot that retbind.h was generated.

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): Couldn't print a single page. Fixed.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.[Ch]: Switched to C callbacks using
	macros, renamed static callback-target member functions to suit new
	scheme and made them public.
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_print.fd: ditto.
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_copyright.fd: ditto.

	* src/support/lxtl.h: small cleanup to use typedef instead of #define
	for gui_format.

	* src/xtl/: New directory containing a minimal distribution of XTL.
	This is XTL-1.3.pl.4.

	* development/tools/lxtl.sh: A script to generate the above mini-dist.

2000-04-15  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* development/tools/makeLyXsigc.sh: Remove the library version numbers

	* sigc++/:  Updated to libsigc++-1.0.0

2000-04-14  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/frontends/xforms/xform_macros.h: Remove specific macros and just
	use the generic ones in future.  I'll modify my conversion script.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.C: Reverse the earlier change.

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.[Ch]: Removed references to form_print.
	(CloseAllBufferRelatedDialogs): Renamed.
	(updateAllVisibleBufferRelatedDialogs): ditto. Added LaTeXLog

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.C: Use the specific macros instead
	of the generic ones.  These are the same ones my conversion script
	generates.

	* src/PrinterParams.h: Allow you to print a range of odd or even pages.
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.C (apply, update): ditto+small cleanup
	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): ditto

	* src/LyXView.C (LyXView): Use new signals instead of old hard coded
	functions for updating and hiding buffer dependent dialogs.
	* src/BufferView.C (buffer): ditto
	* src/buffer.C (setReadonly): ditto
	* src/lyxfunc.C (CloseBuffer): ditto

	* src/buffer.h: Take setReadonly() out of line so I don't have to include
	Dialogs.h, and hence all the SigC stuff, into every file that includes
	buffer.h.  We also don't need to include lyx_gui_misc.h in everything.

	* src/BufferView2.C: reduce the number of headers included by buffer.h

2000-04-11  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/frontends/xforms/xform_macros.h:  A small collection of macros
	for building C callbacks.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Makefile.am: Added above file.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.[Ch]: Revised the C callback
	scheme again.  This time it should work for JMarc.  If this is
	successful I'll revise my conversion script to automate some of this.
	The static member functions in the class also have to be public for
	this scheme will work.  If the scheme works (it's almost identical to
	the way BufferView::cursorToggleCB is handled so it should work) then
	FormCopyright and FormPrint will be ready for inclusion into the main
	trunk immediately after 1.1.5 is released -- provided we're prepared
	for complaints about lame compilers not handling XTL.

	* src/support/lxtl.h: Switched to XDR_format instead of raw_format.

2000-04-07  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4:  A bit more tidying up (Angus)

	* src/LString.h: JMarc's <string> header fix

	* src/PrinterParams.h: Used string for most data to remove some
	ugly code in the Print dialog and avoid even uglier code when 
	appending the ints to a string for output.

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): Added a couple of braces to fix an error
	and moved "default:" back to the end of switch statement.  Cleaned
	up the printing so it uses the right function calls and so the
	"print to file" option actually puts the file in the right directory.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Dialogs.C: Added FormPrint (Angus).

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.C (PrintInputCB): moved input checking
	and Ok+Apply button control into a separate method: input (Angus).
	(input) Cleaned it up and improved it to be very thorough now.
	(All CB) static_cast used instead of C style cast (Angus).  This will
	probably change again once we've worked out how to keep gcc-2.8.1 happy
	with real C callbacks.
	(update) add a few "default:" labels to switches. Egcs-1.1.2 seems to
	ignore some of the bool settings and has random numbers instead. Needs
	some more investigation.  Added other input length checks and checking
	of file and printer names.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.h: Removed pragma statement so it
	would link (Angus).  Seems the old code doesn't compile with the pragma
	statement either.  Separated callback entries from internal methods.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): LFUN_MENUPRINT calls new dialog (Angus).

2000-03-17  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxfunc.[Ch] (isAvailable): This is only temporary.  Do we really
	need it?  Maybe it could go in Dialogs instead?  I could make it a
	LFUN but you'd have to call Dispatch(int, int, char*) with dummy
	values to get the bool return value.
	(Dispatch): New overloaded method for xtl support.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.[Ch]: Modified to use a friendly
	extern "C" callback instead of static member functions.  Hopefully,
	JMarc will be able to compile this.  I haven't changed 
	forms/form_copyright.fd yet. Breaking one of my own rules already.

	* src/commandtags.h: New xtl-based LFUN's no description in LyXAction
	because they aren't useful from the minibuffer.  Maybe a LyXServer
	might want a help message though?

	* src/buffer.[Ch] (Dispatch): New overloaded method for xtl support.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4: Changes to g++ flags to suit compiling with
	xtl which needs both rtti and exceptions.

	* src/support/Makefile.am:
	* src/support/lxtl.h: New file.  Some helper macros for using XTL.

	* src/frontends/xforms/input_validators.[ch]: input filters and
	validators.  These conrol what keys are valid in input boxes.
	Use them and write some more.  Much better idea than waiting till
	after the user has pressed Ok to say that the input fields don't make
	sense.

	* src/frontends/xforms/Makefile.am:
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/form_print.fd:
	* src/frontends/xforms/forms/makefile:
	* src/frontends/xforms/FormPrint.[Ch]: Ported previous print form to
	new scheme.  Still have to make sure I haven't missed anything from
	the current implementation.

	* src/Makefile.am, src/PrinterParams.h: New data store.

	* other files: Added a couple of copyright notices.

2000-03-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insetbib.h: move Holder struct in public space.

	* src/frontends/include/DialogBase.h: use SigC:: only when
	SIGC_CXX_NAMESPACES is defined.
	* src/frontends/include/Dialogs.h: ditto.

	* sigc++/Makefile.am (%.h): use the autodected GNU m4.

	* src/frontends/xforms/FormCopyright.[Ch]: do not
	mention SigC:: explicitely.

2000-03-03  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_USE_FRONTEND): move the code which
	deals with testing KDE in main configure.in
	* configure.in: ditto.

2000-02-22  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* Lots of files: Merged from HEAD

	* All Makefile.am (ETAGS_ARGS): use parameter that is also compatible
	with the etags shipped with SuSE-6.3 (fancier than gnu-etags).

	* autogen.sh: Fix JMarcs complaints by building a sigc++/acinclude.m4

	* sigc++/: new minidist.

2000-02-14  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* development/tools/makeLyXsigc.sh:  Small fix for Makefile.am

2000-02-08  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/frontends/kde/dlg/formcopyrightdialog.kdevdlg: the dialog data
	file for the buildin GUI builder of KDevelop of the copyright-dialog.

	* src/frontends/kde/lyxgui.kdevprj: I added this as I use KDevelop
	for this port and so it is much easier for other people to port
	dialogs in a common development environment.

	* src/frontends/kde/formcopyrightdialog_moc.C: needed MOC file for
	the QT/KDE implementation.

	* src/frontends/kde/Dialogs.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/FormCopyright.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/FormCopyright.h:
	* src/frontends/kde/Makefile.am:
	* src/frontends/kde/formcopyrightdialog.C:
	* src/frontends/kde/formcopyrightdialog.h:
	* src/frontends/kde/formcopyrightdialogdata.C: added this source-files
	for the kde support of the Copyright-Dialog.

	* src/frontends/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): now uses @FRONTEND@
	subdir-substitution instead of hardcoded 'xforms' as we now have also
	the kde subdir.

	* src/frontends/include/DialogBase.h (Object): just commented the
	label after #endif (nasty warning and I don't like warnings ;)

	* src/main.C (main): added KApplication initialization if using
	KDE frontend-GUI.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (runTime): added support for multiple toolkit support.
	For now only the KDE event-loop is added if frontend==kde.

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): added @FRONTEND_xxx@ support

	* configure.in: added support for the --with-frontend[=value] option

	* autogen.sh: added kde.m4 file to list of config-files

	* acconfig.h: added define for KDEGUI-support

	* config/kde.m4: added configuration functions for KDE-port

	* config/lyxinclude.m4: added --with-frontend[=value] option with
	support for xforms and KDE.

2000-02-08  Allan Rae <rae@lyx.org>

	* all Makefile.am:  Fixed up so the make targets dist, distclean, 
	install and uninstall all work even if builddir != srcdir.  Still
	have a new sigc++ minidist update to come.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4: Some more builddir!=srcdir fixes.

2000-02-01  Allan Rae <rae@lyx.org>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4, development/tools/makeLyXsigc.sh:
	Many mods to get builddir != srcdir working.
	
	* sigc++/: Upgraded to 0.8.7.  This includes many needed fixes both
	for building on NT and so we can do the builddir != srcdir stuff.

2000-01-30  Allan Rae <rae@lyx.org>

	* sigc++/doc/*: Selected documentation for the libsigc++ mini dist.
	This will stay in "rae" branch.  We probably don't really need it in
	the main trunk as anyone who wants to help programming it should get
	a full library installed also.  So they can check both included and
	system supplied library compilation.

	* sigc++/*, sigc++/macros/*, config/sigc++.m4, config/lyxinclude.m4:
	Added a 'mini' distribution of libsigc++.  If you feel the urge to 
	change something in these directories - Resist it.  If you can't 
	resist the urge then you should modify the following script and rebuild
	the dist.  LYX_WITH_SIGC in lyxinclude.m4 is the wrapper to make it
	all happen.  Still uses a hacked version of libsigc++'s configure.in.
	I'm quite happy with the results.  I'm not sure the extra work to turn
	the sigc++/configure.in into a few extra AC_DEFUNs in sigc++.m4 is
	worth the trouble and would probably lead to extra maintenance 
	headaches.
	I haven't tested the following important make targets: install, dist.
	Not ready for prime time but very close.  Maybe 1.1.5.

	* development/tools/makeLyXsigc.sh:  A shell script to automatically
	generate our mini-dist of libsigc++.  It can only be used with a CVS
	checkout of libsigc++ not a tarball distribution.  It's well commented.
	This will end up as part of the libsigc++ distribution so other apps
	can easily have an included mini-dist.  If someone makes mods to the
	sigc++ subpackage without modifying this script to generate those
	changes I'll be very upset!

	* src/frontends/:  Started the gui/system indep structure.

	* src/frontends/include/Dialogs.h: Dialog container. All the Signal<>s
	to access the gui-indep dialogs are in this class.  Much improved
	design compared to previous revision.  Lars,  please refrain from
	moving this header into src/ like you did with Popups.h last time.

	* src/frontends/include/DialogBase.h: Abstract base class for dialogs.

	* src/frontends/xforms/:  Started the gui-indep system with a single
	dialog: FormCopyright.  Initial testing of use of libsigc++ was very
	successful.

	* src/frontends/xforms/forms: Repository for the xforms .fd files.
	Here you'll find a very useful makefile and automated fdfix.sh that
	makes updating dailogs a no-brainer -- provided you follow the rules
	set out in the README.  I'm thinking about adding another script to
	automatically generate skeleton code for a new dialog given just the
	name of the dialog.

	* src/commandtags.h, src/lyxfunc.C, src/menus.C:
	* src/credits.{Ch}, src/credits_form.{Ch}, forms/credits_form.fd:
	Made FormCopyright gui-indep and added a lyxfunc to get to it.

2000-06-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/LSubstring.C (operator): simplify

	* src/lyxtext.h: removed bparams, use buffer_->params instead
	
	* src/lyxrow.h: make Row a real class, move all variables to
	private and use accessors.

	* src/lyxparagraph.h (getParLanguage): add BufferParamas as
	arguament.
	(isRightToLeftPar): ditto
	(ChangeLanguage): ditto
	(isMultiLingual): ditto
	(String): ditto
	(TeXOnePar): ditto
	(SimpleTeXOnePar): ditto
	(TeXEnvironment): ditto

	* src/lyxcursor.h: make LyXCursor a real class, move all variables
	to private and use accessors.

	* src/lyx_cb.C: remove char updatetimer, and all code that uses

	* src/text.C (DeleteLineForward): set selection to true to avoid
	that DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism does some magic. This is how it
	is done in all other functions, and seems reasonable.
	(DeleteWordForward): do not jump over non-word stuff, since
	CursorRightOneWord() already does it.
	
	Remove the CHECK tag from DeleteLineForward, DeleteWordForward and

	* src/lyxparagraph.h: renamed ClearParagraph() to
	StripLeadingSpaces() and moved it to paragraph.C. We pass the
	textclass as parameter, and do nothing if free_spacing is
	true. This fixes part of the line-delete-forward problems.

	(pasteSelection): ditto.
	(SwitchLayoutsBetweenClasses): more translatable strings.

2000-05-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/menus.C (Add_to_toc_menu): fix the code which limits the
	size of items: use a constant intead of the hardcoded 40, and more
	importantly do not remove the %m and %x tags added at the end.
	(Add_to_refs_menu): use vector::size_type instead of
	unsigned int as basic types for the variables. _Please_ do not
	assume that size_t is equal to unsigned int. On an alpha, this is
	unsigned long, which is _not_ the same.

	* src/language.C (initL): remove language "hungarian", since it
	seems that "magyar" is better.

2000-05-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/vc-backend.*: renamed stat() to status() and vcstat to
	vcstatus. It happens that Tru64 Unix 5.0 has stat() as a macro and

2000-05-17  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/BufferView2.C (removeAutoInsets): fixed use of AutoDeleteInsets
	which was wrong if the removing caused removing of rows!

	when creating from old insettext.

	* src/tabular.C (Clone): added Clone of text-inset for undo-handling.

2000-05-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	fixed maxWidth.
	(draw): added a frame border when the inset is locked.
	(SetDrawLockedFrame): this sets if we draw the border or not.
	(SetFrameColor): this sets the frame color (default=insetframe).

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: added x() and y() functions which return
	the top_x and top_baseline values. Added a GetFirstLockingInsetOfType
	function which is needed to see if we have a locking inset of some
	type in this inset (needed for now in insettabular).

	* src/vspace.C (inPixels): the same function also without a BufferView
	parameter as so it is easier to use it in some ocasions.

	* src/lyxfunc.C: changed all places where insertInset was used so
	that now if it couldn't be inserted it is deleted!

	* src/TabularLayout.C: 
	* src/TableLayout.C: added support for new tabular-inset!

	* add addendum to README.OS2 and small patch (from SMiyata)

2000-05-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* many files: correct the calls to ChangeExtension().

	* src/support/filetools.C (ChangeExtension): remove the no_path
	argument, which does not belong there. Use OnlyFileName() instead.

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (Latex): use absolute paths for bibtex
	files when LaTeXing a non-nice latex file.

	* src/lyxlookup.C (isDeadEvent): use a switch statement instead of
	a chain of "if". Return false when deadkeys are not handled.
	
	* src/lyx_main.C (LyX): adapted the code for default bindings.

	* src/kbmap.C (defaultKeyBindings): new method. Performs the default
	bindings for basic functionality (except deadkeys).
	(deadKeyBindings): new method. Performs the bindings of deadkeys.

	* src/lyxrc.C (defaultKeyBindings): moved to lyx_main.C 
	several methods: handle override_x_deadkeys.

	* src/lyxrc.h: remove the "bindings" map, which did not make much
	sense anyway. New variable override_x_deadkeys, defaulting to "true".
	
2000-05-09  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (stateText): use a saner method to determine
	whether the font is "default". Seems to fix the crash with DEC
	cxx. 

	* src/Bullet.[Ch] (Bullet): remove const on parameters.

2000-05-08  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (InsetButtonRelease): Now opens the
	TabularLayoutMenu with mouse-button-3
	(LocalDispatch): added LFUN_MENU_LAYOUT to open the Tabular-Layout.

	* src/TabularLayout.C: added this file for having a Layout for
	tabular-insets.

2000-05-05  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (UpdateLocal): resetCursorPos when
	recalculating inset-widths.
	(TabularFeatures): activated this function so that I can change
	tabular-features via menu.

	* src/menus.C (ShowEditMenu): inserted support for insettabular so
	that I can test some functions with the Table menu.

2000-05-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

2000-05-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C (draw): do not display an exclamation mark in the
	margin for margin notes. This is confusing, ugly and
	uninformative. 

	* src/LaTeXFeatures.C (getPackages): load amssymb also when 'Use
	AMS math' is checked.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): do not depend on the textclass
	name to see whether including the amsmath package is needed.

2000-05-05  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/paragraph.C (validate): Compute UsedLanguages correctly
	(don't insert the american language if it doesn't appear in the

	InsetTable.

	* src/mathed/formula.C (drawStr): rename size to siz.

	* src/insets/figinset.C (RestoreForm): rename pflags to piflags,
	possibly fix a bug by not changing the pflags = flags to piflags =

2000-05-04  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C: Prepared all for inserting of multiple
	paragraphs. Still display stuff to do (alignment and other things),
	but I would like to use LyXText to do this when we cleaned out the
	table-support stuff.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C: Changed lot of stuff and added lots
	of functionality still a lot to do.

	* src/tabular.C: Various functions changed name and moved to be
	const functions. Added new Read and Write functions and changed
	lots of things so it works good with tabular-insets (also removed
	some stuff which is not needed anymore * hacks *).

	* src/lyxcursor.h: added operators == and != which just look if
	par and pos are (not) equal.

	* src/buffer.C (latexParagraphs): inserted this function to latex
	all paragraphs form par to endpar as then I can use this too for
	text-insets.

	* src/text2.C (SetLayout): Changed this to use a cursor this is needed
	so that I can call this to from text insets with their own cursor.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): added the output of one \n after the
	output off all paragraphs (because of the fix below)!

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): removed output of \n when we are in
	the very last paragraph (this could be also the last paragraph of an
	inset!)

	* src/insets/figinset.C (various): Use IsFileReadable() to make
	sure that the file actually exist. Relying on ghostscripts errors
	is a bad idea since they can lead to X server crashes.	

2000-04-27  Claus Hentschel <claus.hentschel@mbau.fh-hannover.de>

	* intl/loadmsgcat.c (_nl_load_domain): pass O_BINARY as flag to

	* buffer.C: Dispatch  returns now a bool to indicate success

	* lyx_gui.h:
	* lyx_gui.C: Add getLyXView() for member access

	Buffer::Dispatch (possibly without GUI), if that fails, use
	LyXFunc::Dispatch

	* lyx_main.C: Add support for --import command line switch.
	Now 'lyx --import ascii file.txt' opens the GUI with file.txt loaded.
	Available Formats: Everything  accepted by 'buffer-import <format>'

	buffer spacing and klyx spacing support.

2000-04-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (init): using a LyXCursor now for cursor
	position. Set the inset_owner of the used paragraph so that it knows

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.[Ch]: add free_spc to Latex() method.

	* src/insets/insetfoot.[Ch]: Clone() always returns an Inset* (well I
	know it is right to return InsetFoot* too, but cxx does not like
	it...). 

	* src/insets/insetcollapsable.[Ch] (Clone): make const.

	* development/lyx.spec.in: unset LINGUAS to avoid i18n problems.

	* src/mathed/math_delim.C: change == to proper assignment.

2000-03-09  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (setPos): fixed various cursor positioning
	problems (via mouse and cursor-keys)
	(LocalDispatch): added posibility to add a Ctrl-Enter inside a text
	inset (still a small display problem but it works ;)

	* src/insets/insetcollapsable.C (draw): added button_top_y and
	button_bottom_y to have correct values for clicking on the inset.

	* src/support/lyxalgo.h: commented out 'using std::less'

2000-03-08  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insetcollapsable.C (InsetButtonRelease): Now a
	Button-Release event closes as it is alos the Release-Event
	which opens it.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): forgot a break in the LFUN_INSET_ERT

2000-03-07  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@camel.internal.sylvan.com>

	* lib/layouts/literate-scrap.inc: Fixed initial comment. Now we
	can add multiple spaces in Scrap (literate programming) styles...
	which, by the way, is how I got hooked on LyX to begin with.

	* src/mathed/formula.C (Write): Added dummy variable to an
	inset::Latex() call.
	(Latex): Add free_spacing boolean to inset::Latex()

	* src/mathed/formula.h (Latex):	Added free_spacing boolean arg.
	
	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: Changed definition of the inset::Latex()
	virtual function to include the free_spacing boolean from
	the containing paragraph's style.

	* src/insets/inseturl.C, src/insets/inseturl.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insettext.C, src/insets/insettext.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetspecialchar.C, src/insets/insetspecialchar.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean and made sure that if in a free_spacing
	paragraph, that we output normal space if there is a protected space.
 	
	* src/insets/insetref.C, src/insets/insetref.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetquotes.C, src/insets/insetquotes.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetparent.C, src/insets/insetparent.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C, src/insets/insetlatexaccent.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetlatex.C, src/insets/insetlatex.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetlabel.C, src/insets/insetlabel.h (Latex): Added
	free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h 
	
	* src/insets/insetinfo.C, src/insets/insetinfo.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetinclude.C, src/insets/insetinclude.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetgraphics.C, src/insets/insetgraphics.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/inseterror.C, src/insets/inseterror.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetcommand.C, src/insets/insetcommand.h (Latex):
	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetbib.C, src/insets/insetbib.h (Latex): Added
	free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/figinset.C, src/insets/figinset.h (Latex): Added
	free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): Fix this to
	ignore free_spacing paragraphs. The user's spaces are left
	alone. 
	
	* src/text.C (InsertChar): Fixed the free_spacing layout
	attribute behavior. Now, if free_spacing is set, you can
	add multiple spaces in a paragraph with impunity (and they
	get output verbatim).
	(SelectSelectedWord): Added dummy argument to inset::Latex()
	call.
	
	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): Added dummy args to inset::Latex(...)
	calls.
	
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): Hard-spaces input in free_spacing
	paragraph layouts now only input a simple space instead.
	Special character insets don't make any sense in free-spacing
	paragraphs.
	
	* src/buffer.C (parseSingleLyXformat2Token): Code to convert
	hard-spaces in the *input* file to simple spaces if the layout
	is free-spacing. This converts old files which had to have
	hard-spaces in free-spacing layouts where a simple space was
	preferrable.
	(writeFileAscii): Added free_spacing check to pass to the newly
	reworked inset::Latex(...) methods. The inset::Latex() code
	ensures that hard-spaces in free-spacing paragraphs get output
	as spaces (rather than "~").
	
2000-03-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>
	
	* src/mathed/math_delim.C (draw): draw the empty placeholder
	delims with a onoffdash line.
	(struct math_deco_compare): struct that holds the "functors" used
	for the sort and the binary search in math_deco_table.
	(class init_deco_table): class used for initial sort of the
	math_deco_table. 
	(search_deco): use lower_bound to do a binary search in the
	math_deco_table.

2000-03-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxrc.C: a small secret thingie...

	* src/lyxlex.C (printTable): changed to take a ostream as paramter
	and to not flush the stream as often as it used to.

	* src/support/lyxalgo.h: new file 
	(sorted): template function used for checking if a sequence is
	sorted or not. Two versions with and without user supplied
	compare. Uses same compare as std::sort.

	* src/lyxlex.C (LyXLex): check if the table is sorted, if not sort
	it and give warning on lyxerr.
	(pushTable): ditto
	(struct compare_tags): struct with function operators used for
	checking if sorted, sorting and lower_bound.
	(search_kw): use lower_bound instead of manually implemented
	binary search.

2000-03-08  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insetcollapsable.h: fix Clone() declaration.
	* src/insets/insetfoot.h: ditto.

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: remove an extra comma at the end of enum.

2000-03-08  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: added owner call which tells us if
	this inset is inside another inset. Changed also the return-type
	of Editable to an enum so it tells clearer what the return-value is.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): fixed computing of
	textinsets which split automatically on more rows.

	* src/insets/insetert.[Ch]: changed this to be of BaseType
	InsetCollapsable.

	* src/insets/insetfoot.[Ch]: added footnote inset

	* src/insets/insetcollapsable.[Ch]: added this BaseClass for
	collapsable insets (like footnote, ert, ...)

2000-03-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxdraw.h: remvoe file

	* src/lyxdraw.C: remove file

	* src/insets/insettext.C: added <algorithm>.

2000-03-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_panel.C (delim_cb): case MM_OK use string stream
	(matrix_cb): case MM_OK use string stream

	* src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): case LFUN_SETXY use string
	stream.

	* src/mathed/math_macro.C (draw): use string stream
	(Metrics): use string stream

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXFootnote): for case LyXParagraph::FIG, write
	directly to the ostream.

	* src/vspace.C (asString): use string stream.
	(asString): use string stream
	(asLatexString): use string stream

	* src/lyx_cb.C (UpdateLayoutDocument): use string stream for
	setting Spacing::Other.

	* src/LaTeXFeatures.C (getPackages): use string stream instead of
	sprintf when creating the stretch vale.

	* src/text2.C (alphaCounter): changed to return a string and to
	not use a static variable internally. Also fixed a one-off bug.
	(SetCounter): changed the drawing of the labels to use string
	streams instead of sprintf.

	* src/support/lyxmanip.h: rewrite the newlineanDepth ostream
	manipulator to use a scheme that does not require library support.
	This is also the way it is done in the new GNU libstdc++. Should
	work with DEC cxx now. 

2000-03-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_inset.h (Write(ostream & os): add a space at the
	end. This fixes a bug. 

	* src/mathed (all files concerned with file writing): apply the
	USE_OSTREAM_ONLY changes to mathed too.
	
	* src/support/DebugStream.h: make the constructor explicit.

	* src/lyxfont.C (latexWriteStartChanges): small bug related to
	count and ostream squashed.

2000-03-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_la_SOURCES): add lyxmanip.h.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): add a .c_str(), since
	ostringstream uses STL strings, and we might not.

	* src/insets/insetspecialchar.C: add using directive.
	* src/insets/insettext.C: ditto.

2000-03-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/seminar.layout: feeble attempt at a layout for
	seminar.cls, far from completet and could really use some looking
	at from people used to write layout files.

	* src/support/lyxmanip.h (newlineAndDepth): ostream manipulator to
	use instead of the AddNewlineAndDepth funtion in lyx_cb.C. This is
	a lot nicer and works nicely with ostreams.

	* src/mathed/formula.C (draw): a slightly different solution that
	the one posted to the list, but I think this one works too. (font
	size wrong in headers.)

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): some fiddling on
	Jürgens turf, added some comments that he should read.

	* src/lyxrc.C: remove all traces of RC_NOMENUACCELERATORS, never
	used and it gave compiler warnings.
	RC_SHOW_BANNER + "\\show_banner" added, also to reading and
	writing of lyxrc.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): do the right thing when
	show_banner is true/false.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TimerCB): no need to close or do anything if
	show_banner is false.

	* most file writing files: Now use iostreams to do almost all of
	the writing. Also instead of passing string &, we now use
	stringstreams. mathed output is still not adapted to iostreams.
	This change can be turned off by commenting out all the occurences
	of the "#define USE_OSTREAM_ONLY 1" lines.
	
	* src/WorkArea.C (createPixmap): don't output debug messages.
	(WorkArea): don't output debug messages.

	* lib/lyxrc.example: added a comment about the new variable
	\show_banner 

	* development/Code_rules/Rules: Added some more commente about how
	to build class interfaces and on how better encapsulation can be
	achieved. 

2000-03-03  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insetert.C (InsetERT): Now ERT-insets break row
	automatically with the width of the LyX-Window

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): fixed update bug in
	displaying text-insets (scrollvalues where not initialized!)

2000-03-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): using only res->id ==
	id in the check of the result from lower_bound is not enough since
	lower_bound can return last too, and then res->id will not be a
	valid construct.

	*  all insets and some code that use them: I have conditionalized
	removed the Latex(string & out, ...) this means that only the
	Latex(ostream &, ...) will be used. This is a work in progress to
	move towards using streams for all output of files. 

	* src/text.C (GetColumnNearX): initialize LyXParagraph::size_type
	c to 0.

2000-03-02  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): fix the search
	routine (this fixes bug where greek letters were surrounded by too
	much white space).

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): change a bit the search
	algorithm, to fix bug introduced in 1.1.4. Note that --format is
	no longer passed to kpsewhich, we may have to change that later.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_PROG_CXX): better version-dependent
	warning options to avoid problems with X header files (from Angus
	Leeming).
	* acinclude.m4: regenerated.

2000-03-02  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (WriteParagraphData): Using the
	par->writeFile() function for writing paragraph-data.
	(Read): Using buffer->parseSingleLyXformat2Token()-function
	for parsing paragraph data!

	* src/buffer.C (readLyXformat2): removed all parse data and using
	the new parseSingleLyXformat2Token()-function.
	(parseSingleLyXformat2Token): added this function to parse (read)
	lyx-file-format (this is called also from text-insets now!)

2000-03-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C (BeginningOfMainBody): initialize previous_char
	and temp.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch(LFUN_MENUSEARCH)): Do the Search dialog
	directly instead of going through a func. One very bad thing: a
	static LyXFindReplace, but I don't know where to place it. 

	* src/lyxfr1.C (GetCurrentSelectionAsString): rewritten to use a
	string instead of char[]. Also changed to static.
	(GetSelectionOrWordAtCursor): changed to static inline
	(SetSelectionOverLenChars): ditto.

	* src/lyxfr0.[Ch] src/lyxfr1.[Ch]: rewrite to get rid of
	current_view and global variables. both classes has changed names
	and LyXFindReplace is not inherited from SearchForm.
	
	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C (CloseAllBufferRelatedPopups): remove the
	fl_form_search form.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): removed the fl_form_search form.

2000-03-01  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/bind/*.bind: make sure 'buffer-previous' function is not
	bound (from Kayvan).

	* src/insets/Makefile.am (libinsets_la_SOURCES): add BoundingBox.h.

	* lib/layouts/stdletter.inc: fix line spacing in Send_To_Address.

2000-03-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* some things that I should comment but the local pub says head to
	swirly... 
	
	* comment out all code that belongs to the Roff code for Ascii
	export of tables. (this is unused)
	
	* src/LyXView.C: use correct type for global variable
	current_layout. (LyXTextClass::size_type)

	* some code to get the new insetgraphics closer to working I'd be
	grateful for any help.
	
	* src/BufferView2.C (insertInset): use the return type of
	NumberOfLayout properly. (also changes in other files)

	* src/insets/insetspecialchar.[Ch]: add the PROTECTED SEPARATOR to
	this as a test. I want to know what breaks because of this.

	* src/BufferView.[Ch] (tripleClick): name change from trippleClick.

2000-02-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/stdlists.inc: changed the lyxlist latex definition
	to use a \makebox in the label, this allows proper justification
	with out using protected spaces or multiple hfills. Now it is
	"label" for left justified, "\hfill label\hfill" for center, and
	"\hfill label" for right justified. UserGuide.lyx sec. 3.3.6.5
	should be changed accordingly. 

2000-02-28  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxtext.h: change SetLayout() to take a
	LyXTextClass::size_type instead of a char (when there is more than
	127 layouts in a class); also change type of copylayouttype.
	* src/text2.C (SetLayout): ditto.
	* src/LyXView.C (updateLayoutChoice): ditto.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanLogFile): errors where the line number was not
	given just after the '!'-line were ignored (from Dekel Tsur).

	* lib/lyxrc.example: fix description of \date_insert_format

	* lib/layouts/llncs.layout: new layout, contributed by Martin
	Vermeer. 

2000-02-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_PROG_CXX): remove case support for gcc
	2.7.* and add case support for gcc 2.96*. Gcc 2.96 only exists in
	cvs at gcc.gnu.org (currently it fails with ICE on insetbib.C,
	insetindex.C, insetloa.C, insettext.C, filetools.C, BufferView.C,
	BufferView2.C, LyXView.C, buffer.C, lyx_cb.C, lyxfunc.C,
	paragraph.C, text.C, text2.C)

2000-02-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (LocalDispatch): remove extra break
	statement. 

	* src/insets/insetert.[Ch] (Clone): change return value to Inset*
	* src/insets/insettext.[Ch] (Clone): change return value to Inset*

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.[Ch] (draw): add missing const qualifier
	* src/insets/insettext.[Ch] (GetCursorPos): ditto

	* src/insets/insetbib.h: move InsetBibkey::Holder and
	InsetCitation::Holder in public space.

2000-02-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insettext.h: small change to get the new files from
	Juergen to compile (use "string", not "class string").

	* src/insets/insettext.[Ch], src/insets/insertert.[Ch]: use string
	const & as parameter to LocalDispatch, use LyXFont const & as
	paramter to some other func. This also had impacto on lyxinsets.h
	and the two mathed insets.

2000-02-24  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/buffer.C:
	* src/commandtags.h: 
	* src/LyXAction.C:
	* src/lyxfunc.C: added code for LFUN_INSET_ERT and LFUN_INSET_TEXT

	* src/BufferView.h
	* src/BufferView.C
	* src/BufferView2.C: added/updated code for various inset-functions

	* src/insets/insetert.[Ch]: added implementation of InsetERT

	* src/insets/insettext.[Ch]: added implementation of InsetText

	* src/insets/inset.C (Edit): added "unsigned int button" parameter
	(draw): added preliminary code for inset scrolling not finshed yet

	* src/insets/inset.C (LocalDispatch): changed arg parameter to string
	as it is in lyxfunc.C now

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: Added functions for text-insets

2000-02-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C src/UpdateInset.[Ch]: move the updateinsetlist into
	BufferView and reimplement the list as a queue put inside its own
	class.

	* src/bufferlist.[Ch] (updateInset): remove func, not needed.

	* several files: use the new interface to the "updateinsetlist"
	
	* src/WorkArea.C (work_area_handler): call BufferView::doubleClick
	on doubleclick.
	(work_area_handler): call BufferView::trippleClick on trippleclick.

	* src/BufferView.C (doubleClick): new function, selects word on
	doubleclick. 
	(trippleClick): new function, selects line on trippleclick.

2000-02-22  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/bind/xemacs.bind: buffer-previous not supported

2000-02-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insettoc.[Ch] (LinuxDoc, DocBook): mark the methods

	text.C 
	(getLetterDirection): ditto
	
2000-02-18  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* WorkArea, Painter, LyXScreen: Fixed the crash that occured on
	resize due to wrong pixmap beeing used. Also took the opurtunity
	to make the LyXScreen stateless on regard to WorkArea and some
	general cleanup in the same files.
	
2000-02-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/Makefile.am: add missing direction.h

	* src/PainterBase.h: made the width functions const.
	
	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: fix a couple of entries and define some
	missing ones.
	
	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (draw): draw Editable as buttons.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (draw): make the accents draw

	* several files: remove the old drawing code, now we use the new
	painter only.

	* several files: remove support for mono_video, reverse_video and
	fast selection.

2000-02-17  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/mathed/math_cursor.[Ch] (SelGetArea): Changed form int * to
	int ** as we have to return the pointer, otherwise we have only
	NULL pointers in the returning function.

2000-02-16  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/LaTeX.C (operator()): quote file name when running latex.

2000-02-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/toolbar.C (set): use fl_set_object_helper for the tooltop
	(bubble tip), this removes our special handling of this.

	* Remove all code that is unused now that we have the new
	workarea. (Code that are not active when NEW_WA is defined.)

	* Make the uses of XSync not conditionalized on define USE_XSYNC.
	
2000-02-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): fix LFUN_LAYOUT when giving a
	nonexisting layout; correctly redirect obsoleted layouts.

	* lib/lyxrc.example: document \view_dvi_paper_option

	* src/lyxrc.[Ch]: add support for the \view_dvi_paper_option
	variable. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (RunScript): handle $$FName for command names. 
	(PreviewDVI): handle the view_dvi_paper_option variable.
	[Both from Roland Krause]

2000-02-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/Painter.C (text(int,int,char,LyXFont)): call text(int, int,
	char const *, int, LyXFont)
	(text(int, int, string, LyXFont)): ditto 

	* src/text.C (InsertCharInTable): attempt to fix the double-space
	feature in tables too.
	(BackspaceInTable): ditto.
	(GetVisibleRow): make bottom pagebreak line be a onoff line.

2000-02-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (owner): only complain if owner_ is set and bv != 0

	* src/BufferView.C (resizeCurrentBuffer): set the owner of the
	newly found text in textcache to this.
	(buffer): set the owner of the text put into the textcache to 0

	* src/insets/figinset.C (draw): fixed the drawing of figures with
	the new Painter.

	* src/text.C src/mathed/math_cursor.C: nailed and fixed the
	drawing of mathframe, hfills, protected space, table lines. I have
	now no outstanding drawing problems with the new Painter code. 

2000-02-11  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/PainterBase.C (ellipse, circle): do not specify the default
	arguments. 

	* src/LColor.h: add using directive.

	* src/Painter.[Ch]: change return type of methods from Painter& to
	PainterBase&. Add a using directive.

	* src/WorkArea.C: wrap xforms callbacks in C functions
	C_WorkArea_xxx. 

	* lib/layouts/foils.layout: font fix and simplifications from Carl
	Ollivier-Gooch.

2000-02-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* a lot of files: The Painter, LColor and WorkArea from the old
	devel branch has been ported to lyx-devel. Some new files and a
	lot of #ifdeffed code. The new workarea is enabled by default, but
	if you want to test the new Painter and LColor you have to compile
	with USE_PAINTER defined (do this in config.h f.ex.) There are
	still some rought edges, and I'd like some help to clear those
	out. It looks stable (loads and displays the Userguide very well).
	

2000-02-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/buffer.C (pop_tag): revert to the previous implementation
	(use a global variable for both loops).

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: fix definition for \"{e}.

	* src/lyxrc.C (LyXRC): change slightly default date format.

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): Generate a correct latex file when
	there is an English text with a footnote that starts with a Hebrew
	paragraph, or vice versa.
	(TeXFootnote): ditto.

	* src/text.C (LeftMargin): allow for negative values for
	parindent. Thanks to Philip Lehman <lehman@gmx.net> for testing
	this out.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): add iso88595 as a possible choice
	for input encoding (cyrillic)

2000-02-08  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): make combo box taller (from Dekel
	Tsur). 

	* src/toolbar.C (set): ditto
	* src/insets/insetbib.C (create_form_citation_form): ditto

	* lib/CREDITS: added Dekel Tsur.

	* lib/kbd/hebrew.kmap, lib/kbd/null.kmap,
	lib/layouts/heb-article.layout, lib/layouts/heb-letter.layout: new
	hebrew supports files from Dekel Tsur.
	
	* lib/kbd/iso8859-8.cdef: new file, from Tzafrir Cohen
	<tzafrir@technion.ac.il> 

	* src/lyxrc.C: put \date_insert_format at the right place.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): fix the handling of
	BufferParams::sides when writing out latex files.

	* src/BufferView2.C: add a "using" directive.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C (sum): when we use lyxstring,
	ostringstream::str needs an additional .c_str().

2000-02-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.C (ChangeExtension): patch from Etienne
	applied.

	* src/TextCache.C (show): remove const_cast and make second
	parameter non-const LyXText *.

	* src/TextCache.h: use non const LyXText in show.

	* src/paragraph.C (SimpleTeXSpecialChars): patch to make urls work
	with hebrew.

2000-02-04  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: rework to be more flexible.
	
	* several places: don't check if a pointer is 0 if you are going
	to delete it.

	* src/text.C: remove some dead code.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: remove some dead code
	
	* src/buffer.C: move the BufferView funcs to BufferView2.C
	remove all support for insetlatexdel
	remove support for oldpapersize stuff
	made some member funcs const

	* src/kbmap.C: use a std::list to store the bindings in.
	
	* src/BufferView2.C: new file

	* src/kbsequence.[Ch]: new files
	
	* src/LyXAction.C + others: remove all trace of buffer-previous
	
	* src/Bullet.[Ch]: moved ITEMIZE_DEFAULTS inside Bullet.C so that we
	only have one copy in the binary of this table.
	
	* hebrew patch: moved some functions from LyXText to more
	appropriate places. (LyXParagraph, BufferParams, LyXFont)
	
	* several files: remove support for XForms older than 0.88
	whitespace changes.
	remove some #if 0 #endif code
	
	* src/TextCache.[Ch]: new file. Holds the textcache.

	* src/BufferView.C: changes to use the new TextCache interface.
	(waitForX): remove the now unused code.
	
	* src/BackStack.h: remove some commented code

	* lib/bind/emacs.bind: remove binding for buffer-previous

2000-02-03  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* applied the hebrew patch.

	* src/lyxrow.h: make sure that all Row variables are initialized.

	* src/text2.C (TextHandleUndo): comment out a delete, this might
	introduce a memory leak, but should also help us to not try to
	read freed memory. We need to look at this one.

	* src/paragraph.C (SimpleDocBookOneTablePar): initialize column to 0
	(LyXParagraph): initalize footnotekind.

	* src/lyxrc.C (output): added case RC_DATE_INSERT_FORMAT. Jug
	forgot this when applying the patch. Please heed the warnings.

	* src/BufferView.C (buffer): a fix for the buffer-reload problem
	(aka. reformat problem)

	* src/bufferlist.C (exists): made const, and use const_iterator
	(isLoaded): new func.
	(release): use std::find to find the correct buffer.

	* src/bufferlist.h: made getState a const func.
	made empty a const func.
	made exists a const func.
	new func: isLoaded

2000-02-01  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/lyxfunc.C lyxrc.C: changed from insert-date to date-insert

	* po/it.po: updated a bit the italian po file and also changed the
	'file nuovo' for newfile to 'filenuovo' without a space, this did
	annoy me a lot :)
	
	* src/lyxrc.C (LyXRC): added support for a default insert_date_format
	for the new insert_date command.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): added support for a insert_date function
	from jdblair, to insert a date into the current text conforming to
	a strftime format (for now only considering the locale-set and not
	the document-language).

2000-01-28  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (textWidth): hopefully better fix for the Array
	Bounds Read error seen by purify. The problem was that islower is
	a macros which takes an unsigned char and uses it as an index for
	in array of characters properties (and is thus subject to the
	above error).
	(drawText): ditto.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (UpdateLayoutDocument): use a switch to set
	correctly the paper sides radio buttons.
	(UpdateDocumentButtons): ditto.

2000-01-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/kbmap.C (getsym + others): change to return unsigned int,
	returning a long can give problems on 64 bit systems. (I assume
	that int is 32bit on 64bit systems)

2000-01-27  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): fix a the buffer returned by
	LyXLookupString to be zero-terminated. Really fixes problems seen
	by purify, I think.

2000-01-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): "fix" so that we never try to
	write a (char*)0 to the lyxerr stream.

	* src/lastfiles.C: move algorithm before the using statemets.

2000-01-26  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lastfiles.C: move using directives in global scope (egcs 1.x
	complains otherwise).
	* src/table.C: ditto

	* lib/reLyX/reLyX.in: use variable @LYX_DIR@ as built-in data
	directory. 

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in (LYX_DIR): re-introduce this variable
	that I removed earlier... It is really needed.

	* lib/examples/multicol.lyx: new file, splitted from Extended.lyx. 

2000-01-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* INSTALL: update xforms home page URL.

	* lib/configure.m4: fix a bug with unreadable layout files.

	* src/table.C (calculate_width_of_column): add "using std::max"
	directive. 

2000-01-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* several files: marked several lines with "DEL LINE", this is
	lines that can be deleted without changing anything.
	if (<ptr>) // DEL LINE  /* this line is _never_ needed. Delete
	                           checks this anyway */
	        delete <ptr>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C: Changed some debugs to Debug::KEY

	* src/DepTable.C (update): add a "+" at the end when the checksum
	is different. (debugging string only)

	* src/paragraph.C (ReturnNextInsetPointer): fix bug that caused
	the next inset to not be displayed. This should also fix the list
	of labels in the "Insert Crossreference" dialog.

2000-01-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/LSubstring.C (LSubstring): set pos to string::npos
	when regex was not found.

	* src/support/lstrings.C (lowercase): use handcoded transform always.
	(uppercase): ditto

	* src/text.C (Delete): fixed the crash. cursor.par->prev and
	old_cursor.par->prev could be 0.

	* several files: changed post inc/dec to pre inc/dec
	
	* src/lastfiles.C (writeFile): use ostream_iterator and copy to
	write the lastfiles to file.

	* src/BufferView.C (buffer): only show TextCache info when debugging
	(buffer): ditto
	(resizeCurrentBuffer): ditto
	(workAreaExpose): ditto

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-7.cdef: changed to new quoting scheme

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-2.cdef: changed to new quoting scheme

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): make the display of UMLAUT
	a bit better by removing the special case for \i and \j.

2000-01-24  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_main.C (easyParse): remove test for bad comand line
	options, since this broke all xforms-related parsing.

	* src/kbmap.C (getsym): set return type to unsigned long, as
	declared in header. On an alpha, long is _not_ the same as int.

	* src/support/LOstream.h: add a "using std::flush;"

	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto.

2000-01-21  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): use blinding fast file copy instead of
	"a char at a time", now we are doing it the C++ way.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: get rid of struct pidwaitpit, use a
	std::list<int> instead.
	(addpidwait): reflect move to std::list<int>
	(sigchldchecker): ditto

	* src/bmtable.c (fl_set_bmtable_file): have arguments in the X r5
	version also. 

	* src/paragraph.C (FirstPhysicalPar): remove assert and comment
	that obviously was wrong...

	* src/lyxfont.C (textWidth): have c as char c[2] instead of char
	c, this avoids warnings with purify and islower.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: rename struct queue to struct
	queue_element and rewrite to use a std::queue. gsqueue is now a
	std::queue<queue_element>
	(runqueue): reflect move to std::queue
	(addwait): ditto

	* src/support/lstrings.h (tostr): specialize for bool, otherwise
	we would get "1" "0" instead of "true" "false. Also make the tostr
	functions inline.

2000-01-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/buffer.C (writeFileAscii): Disabled code for special groff
	handling of tabulars till I fix this in table.C

2000-01-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/mkdir.C (mkdir): change second argument of mkdir to
	unsigned long int.
	* src/support/lyxlib.h: ditto.

2000-01-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): make accents on top of 'i'
	and 'j' look better. This might fix the "macron" bug that has been
	observed.

	* src/support/lstrings.[Ch] (tostr): reimplement all the tostr
	functions as one template function. Delete the old versions.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: move using std::ifstream inside
	MODERN_STL_STREAMS

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_la_SOURCES): added mkdir.C
	and putenv.C

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.C: delete #include "bufferlist.h" never used

	* src/mathed/formula.C: delete #include "bufferlist.h" never used

	* src/insets/figinset.C (InitFigures): use new instead of malloc
	to allocate memory for figures and bitmaps.
	(DoneFigures): use delete[] instead of free to deallocate memory
	for figures and bitmaps.
	(runqueue): use new to allocate 
	(getfigdata): use new/delete[] instead of malloc/free
	(RegisterFigure): ditto

	* some files: moved some declarations closer to first use, small
	whitespace changes use preincrement instead of postincrement where
	it does not make a difference.
	
	* src/kbmap.[Ch]: delete code according to define NO_HASH, it is a
	step on the way to use stl::containers for key maps. 

	* src/bufferlist.h: add a typedef for const_iterator and const
	versions of begin and end.

	* src/bufferlist.[Ch]: change name of member variable _state to
	state_. (avoid reserved names)
	(makePup): removed
	(getFileNames): returns the filenames of the buffers in a vector.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added ro

	* src/support/putenv.C: new file

	* src/support/mkdir.C: new file

2000-01-20  Allan Rae <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/IEEEtran.layout: Added several theorem environments

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: Example theorem environments and a
	couple of minor additions.

	* lib/doc/LaTeXConfig.lyx.in:  Use URL insets for ftp sites 
	(except for those in footnotes of course)

2000-01-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxlookup.C (CloseLyXLookup): set xic=0; after destruction. 

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): rewrite to use
	std::sort and std::lower_bound instead of qsort and handwritten
	binarysearch.
	(struct compara): struct that holds the functors used by std::sort
	and std::lower_bound in MathedLookupBOP.

2000-01-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/LAssert.h: do not do partial specialization. We do
	not really need it.

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: note that lyx::getUserName() and
	lyx::date() are not in use right now. Should these be suppressed?

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): we do not need the user name here.
	(makeLinuxDocFile): do not put date and user name in linuxdoc
	headers. 

	* src/support/lyxlib.h (kill): change first argument to long int,
	since that's what solaris uses.

	* src/support/kill.C (kill): fix declaration to match prototype.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_NAMESPACES): fix the macro to
	actually check whether namespaces are supported. This is not what
	it used to do.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: add a using directive.

2000-01-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/kill.C: if we have namespace support we don't have
	to include lyxlib.h.

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: use namespace lyx if supported.

2000-01-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/date.C: new file

	* src/support/chdir.C: new file

	* src/support/getUserName.C: new file

	* src/support/getcwd.C: new file

	* src/support/abort.C: new file

	* src/support/kill.C: new file

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: moved all the functions in this file
	insede struct lyx. Added also kill and abort to this struct. This
	is a way to avoid the "kill is not defined in <csignal>", we make
	C++ wrappers for functions that are not ANSI C or ANSI C++.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C (sum): use #ifdef MODERN_STL_STREAMS
	instead of #if __GLIBCPP__. Since lyxsum is now put inside struct
	lyx it has been renamed to sum.

2000-01-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C: add using directives for std::min and std::max.

2000-01-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/texrow.C (getIdFromRow): actually return something useful in
	id and pos. Hopefully fixes the bug with positionning of errorbox
	insets. 

	* src/lyx_main.C (easyParse): output an error and exit if an
	incorrect command line option has been given.

	* src/spellchecker.C (ispell_check_word): document a memory leak.

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): fix mismatched allocation/deletion,
	where a "struct utimbuf" is allocated with "new" and deleted with
	"delete[]". 

2000-01-13  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (CutSelection): don't delete double spaces.
	(PasteSelection): ditto
	(CopySelection): ditto
	
	* src/text.C (Backspace): don't delete double spaces.

	* src/lyxlex.C (next): fix a bug that were only present with
	conformant std::istream::get to read comment lines, use
	std::istream::getline instead. This seems to fix the problem.

2000-01-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): fix for the "not
	allowed to insert space before space" editing problem. Please read
	commends at the beginning of the function. Comments about usage
	are very welcome.

	* src/text.C (InsertChar): fix for the "not allowed to insert
	space before space" editing problem.

	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): when
	IsEmptyTableRow can only return false this last "else if" will
	always be a no-op. Commented out.

	* src/text.C (RedoParagraph): As far as I can understand tmp
	cursor is not really needed.

	* src/lyxtext.[Ch] (IsEmptyTableCell): commented out. As used at
	present it could only return false anyway. 
	(several functions): Did something not so smart...added a const
	specifier on a lot of methods.
	
	* src/paragraph.C (BreakParagraph): removed the tmp->text.reserve
	and add a tmp->text.resize. The LyXParagraph constructor does the
	resize for us.
	(BreakParagraphConservative): ditto

	* src/support/path.h (Path): add a define so that the wrong usage
	"Path("/tmp") will be flagged as a compilation error:
	"`unnamed_Path' undeclared (first use this function)"

2000-01-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_FUNC_PUTENV_ARGTYPE): fix the macro,
	which was bogus for several reasons.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanAux): fix the regular expression used to scan
	.aux files. 
	(runBibTeX): ditto.

	* autogen.sh: do not use "type -path" (what's that anyway?).

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): remove extraneous space
	which caused a kpsewhich warning (at least with kpathsea version
	3.0). 

2000-01-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): use .la

	* src/insets/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): use .la

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): switch back to .la libs

2000-01-11  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/paragraph.C (BreakParagraph): do not reserve space on text
	if we don't need to (otherwise, if pos_end < pos, we end up
	reserving huge amounts of memory due to bad unsigned karma).
	(BreakParagraphConservative): ditto, although I have not seen
	evidence the bug can happen here.

	* src/lyxparagraph.h: add a using std::list.

2000-01-11  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/menus.C (MenuDocu): output an Alert if the documentation-file
	could not be found.

2000-01-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/vc-backend.C (doVCCommand): change to be static and take one
	more parameter: the path to chdir too be fore executing the command.
	(retrive): new function equiv to "co -r"

	* src/bufferlist.C (loadLyXFile): implement the missing parts if
	file_not_found_hook is true.

	* src/lyxvc.C (file_not_found_hook): implement file_not_found_hook.

	* src/support/filetools.C (IsFileWriteable): use FileInfo to check
	if a file is readwrite,readonly...anything else.

2000-01-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MakeLaTeXOutput): name change from MakeDVIOutput
	(CreatePostscript): name change from MenuRunDVIPS (or something)
	(PreviewPostscript): name change from MenuPreviewPS
	(PreviewDVI): name change from MenuPreviewDVI

	* lib/lyxrc.example: added \pdflatex_command, \pdf_mode,
	\view_pdf_command., \pdf_to_ps_command

	* lib/configure.m4: added search for PDF viewer, and search for
	PDF to PS converter. 
	(lyxrc.defaults output): add \pdflatex_command,
	\view_pdf_command and \pdf_to_ps_command.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuPreviewDVI): renamed from MenuPreview.

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): we don't use blocksize for anything so
	I removed it.

2000-01-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/block.h: disable operator T* (), since it causes
	problems with both compilers I tried. See comments in the file.

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: do not define LYX_DIR. support flag
	--with-lyxname. 

	* lib/reLyX/reLyX.in: change LYX_DIR to pkgdatadir; change env.
	variable LYX_DIR_10x to LYX_DIR_11x.

	* src/Makefile.am: replace variable LYX_DIR with pkgdatadir.

	* INSTALL: document --with-lyxname.
	* NEWS: ditto.

	* configure.in: new configure flag --with-lyxname which allows to
	choose the name under which lyx is installed. Default is "lyx", of
	course. It used to be possible to do this with --program-suffix,
	but the later has in fact a different meaning for autoconf.

	* src/support/lstrings.h (lstrchr): reformat a bit.

	* src/lyxlex.h: include LIstream.h, for Sun CC this time.
	* src/mathed/math_defs.h: ditto.

2000-01-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxrc.[Ch]: New tag and variable "\make_backup". Defaults to
	true, decides if we create a backup file or not when saving. New
	tag and variable \pdf_mode, defaults to false. New tag and
	variable \pdflatex_command, defaults to pdflatex. New tag and
	variable \view_pdf_command, defaults to xpdf. New tag and variable
	\pdf_to_ps_command, defaults to pdf2ps.

2000-01-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/bufferlist.C (close): don't call insetUnlock if the buffer
	does not have a BufferView.
	(unlockInset): ditto + don't access the_locking_inset if the
	buffer does not have a BufferView.

	* src/LyXView.C (KeyPressMask_raw_callback): add a XSync in
	certain circumstances so that we don't continue a keyboard
	operation long after the key was released. Try f.ex. to load a
	large document, press PageDown for some seconds and then release
	it. Before this change the document would contine to scroll for
	some time, with this change it stops imidiatly.

	* src/support/block.h: don't allocate more space than needed. As
	long as we don't try to write to the arr[x] in a array_type arr[x]
	it is perfectly ok. (if you write to it you might segfault).
	added operator value_type*() so that is possible to pass the array
	to functions expecting a C-pointer.

	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): don't fail completely if unable to
	cvs.

	* intl/*: updated to gettext 0.10.35, tried to add our own
	required modifications. Please verify.

	* po/*: updated to gettext 0.10.35, tried to add our own required
	modifications. Please verify.
	
	* src/support/lstrings.C (tostr): go at fixing the problem with
	cxx and stringstream. When stringstream is used return
	oss.str().c_str() so that problems with lyxstring and basic_string
	are avoided. Note that the best solution would be for cxx to use
	basic_string all the way, but it is not conformant yet. (it seems)

	* src/lyx_cb.C + other files: moved several global functions to
	class BufferView, some have been moved to BufferView.[Ch] others
	are still located in lyx_cb.C. Code changes because of this. (part
	of "get rid of current_view project".)

	* src/buffer.C + other files: moved several Buffer functions to
	class BufferView, the functions are still present in buffer.C.
	Code changes because of this.

	* config/lcmessage.m4: updated to most recent. used when creating
	acinclude.m4.

	* config/progtest.m4: updated to most recent. used when creating
	acinclude.m4.
	
	* config/gettext.m4: updated to most recent. applied patch for
	tmplinguas.

	* config/gettext.m4.patch: new file that shows what changes we
	have done to the local copy of gettext.m4.

	* config/libtool.m4: new file, used in creation of acinclude.m4

	* config/lyxinclude.m4: new file, this is the lyx created m4
	macros, used in making acinclude.m4.
	
	* autogen.sh: GNU m4 discovered as a separate task not as part of
	the lib/configure creation. 
	Generate acinlucde from files in config. Actually cat
	lyxinclude.m4, libtool.m4 and gettext.m4 together. This makes it
	easier to upgrade .m4 files that really are external.

	* src/Spacing.h: moved using std::istringstream to right after
	<sstream>. This should fix the problem seen with some compilers.

2000-01-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C: began some work to remove the dependency a lot of
	functions have on BufferView::text, even if not really needed.
	(GetCurrentTextClass): removed this func, it only hid the
	current_view. 

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): use support/libsupport.la I
	forgot this in last commit.

	* src/Bullet.C (bulletEntry): use static char const *[] for the
	tables, becuase of this the return arg had to change to string.
	(bulletSize): ditto
	(~Bullet): removed unneeded destructor

	* src/BufferView.C (beforeChange): moved from lyx_cb.C
	(insetSleep): moved from Buffer
	(insetWakeup): moved from Buffer
	(insetUnlock): moved from Buffer

	* buffer.[Ch], BufferView.[Ch] + others: moved the_locking_inset
	from Buffer to BufferView.
	
	* acinclude.m4: include libtool.m4 from libtool 1.3.4.

	* config/ltmain.sh: updated to version 1.3.4 of libtool

	* config/ltconfig: updated to version 1.3.4 of libtool

2000-01-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>


	* src/buffer.C (pop_tag): fix a dubious for() loop initialization.

	* src/Spacing.h: ditto.
	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto.
	* src/support/filetools.C: ditto.

	* src/lyx_cb.C: ditto.
	* src/lyxlex.C: ditto.

	* NEWS: add some changes for 1.1.4.
	
2000-01-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	members of the struct are correctly initialized to 0 (detected by
	purify) 
	* src/lyxrc.C (LyXRC): ditto for print_adapt_output.
	* src/insets/figinset.C (InsetFig): ditto for pswid and pshgh.

	* src/insets/figinset.C (sigchldchecker): use "delete" to free a
	pidwait, since it was allocated with "new". This was potentially
	very bad. Thanks to Michael Schmitt for running purify for us.


2000-01-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C: add a 'using std::make_pair;' statement.

	src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): askForText changes

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.[Ch] (askForText): now returns a bool also so we 
	know when a user has cancelled input. Fixes annoying problems with
	inserting labels and version control.

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): remove an extraneous break statement.

	* src/support/filetools.C (QuoteName): change to do simple
	'quoting'. More work is necessary. Also changed to do nothing
	under emx (needs fix too).
	(Putenv): Cast the argument of putenv() with PUTENV_TYPE_ARG.

	* acinclude.m4 (STL_STRING_FWD_H_LOCATION): add the comment for
	config.h.in to the AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED() call.
	(LYX_FUNC_PUTENV_ARGTYPE): new macro. Checks whether putenv()
	needs char * as argument (because Solaris 7 declares it like
	that). 

	* acconfig.h: remove placeholder for STL_STRING_FWD_H_LOCATION;
	remove definition of BZERO.

1999-12-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/LRegex.C: include <regex.h> if HAVE_REGEX_H is
	defined, "lyxregex.h" if not.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): changed from

	* src/mathed/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): changed from
	pkglib_ to noinst_

	* src/insets/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): changed from
	pkglib_ to noinst_

	* configure.in: add call to LYX_REGEX 

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_REGEX): checks if we need to use the included
	regex or not. Uses a a AM_CONDITIONAL to decide what to compile. 

1999-12-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/bind/fi_menus.bind: new file, from
	pauli.virtanen@saunalahti.fi. 

	* src/buffer.C (getBibkeyList): pass the parameter delim to
	InsetInclude::getKeys and InsetBibtex::getKeys.

	* src/insets/insetinclude.[Ch] (getKeys): add parameter delim, which
	is passed to Buffer::getBibkeyList
	
	* src/insets/insetbib.[Ch] (getKeys): add parameter delim, and use it
	instead of the hardcoded comma.

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (getKeys): make sure that there are not
	leading blanks in bibtex keys. Normal latex does not care, but
	harvard.sty seems to dislike blanks at the beginning of citation
	keys. In particular, the retturn value of the function is

	* INSTALL: make it clear that libstdc++ is needed and that gcc
	2.7.x probably does not work.

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): make debug message go to
	the LATEX channel
	* src/insets/insetbib.C (getKeys): ditto

	* src/debug.C (showTags): make sure that the output is correctly
	aligned. 

	* configure.in: add a comment for TWO_COLOR_ICON define.

	* acconfig.h: remove all the entries that already defined in
	configure.in or acinclude.m4.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): headers of latex file also changed
	to avoid user name, date and copyright.

1999-12-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/table.C (Read): Now read bogus row format informations
		if the format is < 5 so that afterwards the table can
		be read by lyx but without any format-info. Fixed the
		crash we experienced when not doing this.

1999-12-21  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (RedoHeightOfParagraph): rename arg cursor -> cur

	* src/bmtable.h: add extern "C" on this file when __cplusplus is
	defined.

	* src/bmtable.c: new file, a C'ified copy of bmtable.C, this is
	compiled by a C compiler not C++.

	(LyXTextClassList): added typedef for const_iterator + member
	functions begin and end.

	iterators to fill the choice_class.
	(updateLayoutChoice): rewritten to use iterators to fill the
	layoutlist in the toolbar.

	* src/BufferView.h (BufferView::work_area_width): removed unused
	variable. 

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C (WarnReadonly): added string parameter 'file'

	* src/buffer.C (sgmlOpenTag): drop the use of the static space array
	(sgmlCloseTag): ditto

	* src/support/lstrings.h: return type of countChar changed to
	unsigned char.

	* src/support/lstrings.C (countChar): use HAVE_STD_COUNT to choose
	what version of this func to use. Also made to return unsigned int.

	* configure.in: call LYX_STD_COUNT 

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_STD_COUNT): new function checks for a standard
	conforming std::count. 

1999-12-20  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_draw.C (Draw, Metrics): fix a bug where a prime
	and a subscript would give bad display (patch from Dekel Tsur
	<dekel@math.tau.ac.il>). 

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.h: make sure ACCENT_TYPES is public. 

	* src/spellchecker.C (create_ispell_pipe): use a const_cast to
	please sun CC.

	* src/chset.h: add a few 'using' directives

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): check that LFUN_UNKNOWN_ACTION is not
	triggered when no buffer is active

	* src/layout.C: removed `break' after `return' in switch(), since
	it is unreachable.

	* src/lyx_main.C (init): make sure LyX can be ran in place even
	when libtool has done its magic with shared libraries. Fix the
	test for the case when the system directory has not been found.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeLaTeX): make sure to keep the full path
	name for the latex file.
	(MenuMakeHTML): ditto

	* src/buffer.h: add an optional boolean argument, which is passed
	to ChangeExtension.

1999-12-20  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: small correction and update.

	* configure.in: Attempted to use LYX_PATH_HEADER

	* src/stl_string_fwd.h: Don't need HAVE_STL_STRING_FWD_H anymore

	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4 (LYX_STL_STRING_FWD): totally revised after
	input from JMarc.  Now use preprocessor to find the header.
	Also stopped making HAVE_STL_STRING_FWD_H and extended the comments.
	(LYX_PATH_HEADER): My, so far, failed attempt to generalize
	LYX_STL_STRING_FWD.  See comments in file.	

1999-12-19  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* The global MiniBuffer * minibuffer variable is dead.
	
	* The global FD_form_main * fd_form_main variable is dead.

1999-12-17  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/toolbar.C (set): condition #warning on WITH_WARNINGS

	* src/table.h: add the LOstream.h header
	* src/debug.h: ditto
	
	* src/LyXAction.h: change the explaination of the ReadOnly
	attribute: is indicates that the function _can_ be used.

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): find-replace _can_ be used in read-only
	mode. 

1999-12-16  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (ascent): Make sure that char is _always_ used as
	unsigned. 
	(descent): ditto
	(lbearing): ditto
	(rbearing): ditto

	* src/paragraph.C (GetWord): assert on pos>=0
	(GetChar): ditto
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the use of an invariant on
	ENABLE_ASSERTIONS 
	* src/support/lyxstring.h: ditto

	* src/Bullet.[Ch]: replace DEBUG_AS_DEFAULT by ENABLE_ASSERTIONS.
	Use LAssert.h instead of plain assert().

	* src/support/lstrings.h: add LAssert.h, in case it is needed.

	* src/lyxfunc.C: do not include LAssert.h, it is not used.
	* src/support/filetools.C: ditto

	* src/support/LAssert.h: make Assert a no-op if ENABLE_ASSERTIONS
	is not defined. 

	* INSTALL: document the new configure flags
	
	* configure.in: suppress --with-debug; add --enable-assertions

	* acinclude.m4: various changes in alignment of help strings.

1999-12-16  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/kbmap.C: commented out the use of the hash map in kb_map,
	beginning of movement to a stl::container. 

	* several files: removed code that was not in effect when
	MOVE_TEXT was defined.
	
	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: removed bogus backslashes. Backslashes
	for escaping should not be used. We can discuss if the string
	should be enclosed in f.ex. [] instead of "".

	* src/trans_mgr.C (insert): use the new returned value from
	encodeString to get deadkeys and keymaps done correctly.

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): changed to return a pair, to tell
	what to use if we know the string.

	* src/lyxscreen.h (fillArc): new function.

	* src/FontInfo.C (resize): rewritten to use more std::string like
	structore, especially string::replace.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): use fillArc for the
	approp. accents.

	* configure.in (chmod +x some scripts): remove config/gcc-hack 

1999-12-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/buffer.C (writeFile): change once again the top comment in a
	.lyx file to point to www.lyx.org and to use LYX_DOCVERSION
	instead of an hardcoded version number.
	(makeDocBookFile): ditto

	* src/version.h: add new define LYX_DOCVERSION

	* po/de.po: update from Pit Sütterlin
	* lib/bind/de_menus.bind: ditto.
	
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): call MenuExport()
	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): ditto

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeHTML): new function, moved from
	LyXFunc::Dispatch().
	(MenuExport): new function, moved from
	LyXFunc::Dispatch().

	* src/trans_mgr.C (insert): small cleanup
	* src/chset.C (loadFile): ditto

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: add missing backslashes

1999-12-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Lbearing): new function, used to
	help with placing the manually drawn accents better.
	(Rbearing): ditto
	(Draw): x2 and hg changed to float to minimize rounding errors and
	help place the accents better.

	* src/lyxfont.C (ascent): fixed faulty static_cast, casting from
	unsigned short to char is just wrong...cast the char to unsigned
	char instead so that the two values can compare sanely. This
	should also make the display of insetlatexaccents better and
	perhaps also some other insets.
	(descent): ditto
	(lbearing): new function
	(rbearing): ditto

1999-12-15  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/stl_string_fwd.h, src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES):  added new
	header that provides a wrapper around the very annoying SGI STL header
	of the same name.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C, src/LString.h:
	removed old SGI-STL-compatability attempts.

	* configure.in: Use LYX_STL_STRING_FWD.

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_STL_STRING_FWD), acconfig.h: Test if 
	stl_string_fwd.h is around and try to determine it's location.
 	Major improvement over previous SGI STL 3.2 compatability.
	Three small problems remain with this function due to my zero
	knowledge of autoconf.  JMarc and lgb see the comments in the code.

1999-12-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/broken_const.h, config/hack-gcc, config/README: removed
	
	* configure.in: remove --with-gcc-hack option; do not call
	LYX_CXX_STL_STACK 

	* INSTALL: remove documentation of --with-broken-const and
	--with-gcc-hack
	
	* acconfig.h: remove all trace of BROKEN_CONST define

	* src/buffer.C (makeDocBookFile): update version number in output
	file. 
	(SimpleDocBookOnePar): fix an assert when trying to a character
	access beyond string length
	[Patch from Jose']

1999-12-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* po/de.po: fix the Export menu

	* lyx.man: update the description of -dbg

	* src/lyx_main.C (setDebuggingLevel): call Debug::showLevel()
	(commandLineHelp): updated
	(easyParse): show list of available debug levels if -dbg is passed
	without argument.

	* src/Makefile.am: add debug.C

	* src/debug.h: moved some code to debug.C

	* src/debug.C: new file. Contains code to set and show debug
	level. 

	* src/layout.C: remove 'break' after 'continue' in switch
	statements, since these cannot be reached.

1999-12-13  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_hash.C (math_hash): renamed from hash(), name clash.
	(in_word_set): hash() -> math_hash()

	* src/LString.h: Used USING_EXCEPTIONS in SGI STL-3.2 support 

	* acconfig.h: Added a test for whether we are using exceptions in the
	current compilation run. If so USING_EXCEPTIONS is defined.

	* config.in: Check for existance of stl_string_fwd.h
	* src/LString.h: If compiling --with-included-string and SGI's
	STL version 3.2 is present (see above test) we need to block their
	forward declaration of string and supply a __get_c_string().
	However, it turns out this is only necessary if compiling with
	exceptions enabled so I've a bit more to add yet.

	* src/insets/figinset.[Ch], src/insets/insetinclude.C,
	src/insets/insetloa.C, src/layout.h, src/lyxparagraph.h,
	src/support/LRegex.h, src/undo.h:
	Shuffle the order of the included files a little to ensure that
	LString.h gets included before anything that includes stl_string_fwd.h

	*  src/support/lyxstring.C: We need to #include LString.h instead of
	lyxstring.h to get the necessary definition of __get_c_string.
	(__get_c_string): New function.  This is defined static just like SGI's
	although why they need to do this I'm not sure.  Perhaps it should be
	in lstrings.C instead.

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx:  New template file.

1999-12-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>
	
	* Makefile.in.in (MKINSTALLDIRS): use $(srcdir)/@MKINSTALLDIRS@
	* intl/Makefile.in (MKINSTALLDIRS):  ditto

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): changed to hold the LFUN data in a
	automatic array in stead of in callso to newFunc, this speeds up
	compilation a lot. Also all the memory used by the array is
	returned when the init is completed.

	* a lot of files: compiled with -Wold-style-cast, changed most of
	the reported offenders to C++ style casts. Did not change the
	offenders in C files. 

	* src/trans.h (Match): change argument type to unsigned int.

	* src/support/DebugStream.C: fix some types on the streambufs so
	that it works on a conforming implementation.

1999-12-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/examples/example_{raw,lyxified}.lyx: fix embarassing sentence.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: remove the inline added earlier since
	they cause a bunch of unsatisfied symbols when linking with dec
	cxx. Cxx likes to have the body of inlines at the place where they
	are declared.

	* src/trans.C (AddDeadkey): add an 'unsigned char' cast to avoid
	accessing negative bounds in array. This fixes the crash when
	inserting accented characters.
	* src/trans.h (Match): ditto

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): since this is a void, it should not try
	to return anything...

1999-12-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/buffer.h: removed the two friends from Buffer. Some changes
	because of this. Buffer::getFileName and Buffer::setFileName
	renamed to Buffer::fileName() and Buffer::fileName(...).

1999-12-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* buffer.[Ch], BufferView.[Ch] + other files: Moved Buffer::text
	and Buffer::update(short) to BufferView. This move is currently
	controlled by a define MOVE_TEXT, this will be removed when all
	shows to be ok. This move paves the way for better separation
	between buffer contents and buffer view. One side effect is that
	the BufferView needs a rebreak when swiching buffers, if we want
	to avoid this we can add a cache that holds pointers to LyXText's
	that is not currently in use. 

	* buffer.[Ch], lyx_main.C: small changes to the "-export" patch by
	André Pönitz. 

1999-11-18  André Pönitz <poenitz@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de>

	* buffer.[Ch]: Dispatch() - new dispatcher on the buffer level

	* lyx_main.C: new command line option -x (or --execute) and
	  -e (or --export). Now direct conversion from .lyx to .tex
	  (.dvi, .ps, ...) is possible  ('lyx file.lyx --export latex')
	  Unfortunately, X is still needed and the GUI pops up during the
	  process...

1999-12-07  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	writing of files. Done with a close look at Andre Poenitz's patch.

	* some files: whitespace changes.
	
1999-12-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_iter.C (my_memcpy): new function. Since the
	built-in memcpy() is broken on egcs and gcc 2.95 for alpha
	architecture, we provide our own. It is used unconditionnally, but
	I do not think this is a performance problem. Thanks to Angus
	Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk> for the code (and again to Michal
	Jaegermann <michal@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca> for finding it the
	first time).
	(GetInset): use my_memcpy.

	* src/table.C: ditto
	* src/vspace.C: ditto
	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto
	Note: most of these is absolutely harmless, except the one in
	src/mathed formula.C.

1999-11-30  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@satyr.sylvan.com>

	* src/support/filetools.C (ExpandPath): removed an over eager
	Assert.

	image const changes. 

	* commandtags.h, src/LyXAction.C (init): new function:
	"preferences-save", saves the lyxrc entries into .lyx/preferences.
	This file is not read automatically but you can add \input
	preferences to your lyxrc if you want to. We need to discuss how
	to handle this. 

	* src/LaTeX.C (runBibTeX): use regex to match for the needed lines
	in .aux, also remove .bib and .bst files from dependencies when
	running bibtex.

	doubling of allocated space scheme. This makes it faster for large
	strings end to use less memory for small strings. xtra rememoved. 

	* src/insets/figinset.C (waitalarm): commented out.
	(GhostscriptMsg): use static_cast
	(GhostscriptMsg): use new instead of malloc to allocate memory for
	cmap. also delete the memory after use.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (SetXtermCursor): made cursor_undefined a bool

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanAux): new method. Scans the .aux file and looks

	string; call Debug::value.
	(easyParse): pass complete argument to setDebuggingLevel().

	* NEWS: updated for the future 1.1.3 release.

	* src/mathed/symbol_def.h: swap the definitions of \varepsilon and
	\epsilon. Now \epsilon shows as red text, and \varepsilon shows as
	it should. This is of course a controversial change (since many
	people will find that their lyx workscreen is suddenly full of
	red), but done for the sake of correctness.

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.h, src/mathed/math_macro.[Ch],
	  src/mathed/math_root.[Ch] (Clone): return a MathedInset*

	* all classes inherited form MathInset: return value of Clone
	changed back to MathedInset *.
	
	* src/insets/figinset.C (runqueue): use a ofstream to output the
	gs/ps file. Might need some setpresicion or setw. However I can
	see no problem with the current code.

	findtexfile from LaTeX to filetools.
	
	* src/ImportNoweb.C (documentclass): rewrote to use ifstream

	from Thomas Hartkens <thomas@hartkens.de>.

	code on MODERN_STL_STREAM.

	* src/support/L{I,O}stream.h: new files, designed to setup
	correctly streams for our use
	  - includes the right header depending on STL capabilities
	  - puts std::ostream and std::endl (for LOStream.h) or
	  std::istream (LIStream.h) in toplevel namespace.

1999-10-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/LaTeX.C (run): added a check in 0 sumchange so that if it

	getting their absolute path and enter them into the dep file.
	(findtexfile): static func that is used to look for tex-files,
	checks for absolute patchs and tries also with kpsewhich.
	Alternative ways of finding the correct files are wanted. Will
	probably be moved.
	(do_popen): function that runs a command using popen and returns
	the whole output of that command in a string. Should be moved to
	somewhere else.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: moved the definition of lyxstring::Srep
	to lyxstring.C, and only keep a forward declaration in
	lyxstring.h. Simplifies the header file a bit and should help a
	bit on compile time too. Also changes to Srep will not mandate a
	recompile of code just using string.
	(~lyxstring): definition moved here since it uses srep.
	(size): definition moved here since it uses srep.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: removed a couple of "inline" that should

	paragraph when having dummy paragraphs.

1999-10-20  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C: just commented some fl_free_form calls
	and added warnings so that this calls should be activated later
	again. This avoids for now a segfault, but we have a memory leak!

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent) (Dispatch): changed
	'const char * argument' to 'string argument', this should
	fix some Asserts() in lyxstring.C.

	* src/lyxfunc.h: Removed the function argAsString(const char *)
	as it is not used anymore.

	* src/LaTeX.[Ch]: removed scanError. Wrong place and not needed.

	* src/buffer.C (insertErrors): changes to make the error
	desctription show properly.

	* src/LaTeX.C (deplog): removed the test for file in lyx doc dir.
	could never happen

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): changed to use
	sizeof(object->rep->ref).
	(operator>>): changed to use a pointer instead.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: changed const reference & to value_type
	const & lets see if that helps.

1999-10-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	verison.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: removed the compilation guards

	conditional compile of lyxstring.Ch

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): new and improved, still a
	stupid check, but it is a lot better than the bastring hack.

	* several files: changed string::erase into string::clear. Not
	really needed.
	
	* src/chset.C (encodeString): use a char temporary instead

	(MenuBuildProg): added tostr around ret
	(MenuRunChktex): added tostr around ret
	(DocumentApplyCB): added tostr around ret

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): added tostr around t->ic

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around secnumdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around tocdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around ftcound - 1

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (setCounter): added tostr around counter.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: added an operator+=(int) to catch more
	mistakes. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.
	(lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_macro.C (MathMacroArgument::Write,
	MathMacroTemplate::WriteDef): add tostr() around macro arg numbers
	when writing them out.

	* src/LString.C: remove, since it is not used anymore.
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the content to
	USE_INCLUDED_STRING macro.

	* src/mathed/math_symbols.C, src/support/lstrings.C,
	src/support/lyxstring.C: add `using' directive to specify what
	we need in <algorithm>. I do not think that we need to
	conditionalize this, but any thought is appreciated.

	* many files: change all callback functions to "C" linkage
	functions to please strict C++ compilers like DEC cxx 6.1 in mode
	strict_ansi. Those who were static are now global. 
	    The case of callbacks which are static class members is
	trickier, since we have to make C wrappers around them (see
	InsetError, InsetInfo and InsetUrl). The same holds for friends. I
	did not finish this yet, since it defeats the purpose of
	encapsulation, and I am not sure what the best route is.

1999-10-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): we permit to have a null
	pointer as assignment value and just don't assign it.

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): corrected this function substituting
	find_first(_not)_of with find_last_of.

	* src/TableLayout.C (UpdateLayoutTable) (TableOptionsCB)
	(TableOptCloseCB) (TableSpeCloseCB):
	inserted fl_set_focus call for problem with fl_hide_form() in
	xforms-0.89.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (LayoutsCB): fix bug where int was added to a
	string. 

1999-10-18  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxrc.C (Read): RC_PRINTEXSTRAOPTIONS now uses
	LyXLex::next() and not eatline() to get its argument.

1999-10-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/DepTable.[Ch]: rewritten to store the dependencies in a map
	instead, use fstreams for io of the depfile, removed unneeded
	functions and variables. 

	* src/LaTeX.[Ch] (class TeXErrors): rewrote to store the errors in a
	vector instead, removed all functions and variables that is not in
	use.

1999-10-16  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/buffer.C (insertErrors): use new interface to TeXError

	* Makefile.am (rpmdist): added a rpmdist target

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: added RelyxFigure.pm and Verbatim.pm as
	per Kayvan's instructions.

1999-10-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/Makefile.am: add a definition for localedir, so that locales
	are found after installation (Kayvan)

1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* development/.cvsignore: new file.

1999-10-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_CHEADERS): New macro. Checks whether the
	C++ compiler provides wrappers for C headers and use our alternate
	version otherwise.

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_CHEADERS.

	* src/cheader/: new directory, populated with cname headers from
	libstdc++-2.8.1. They are a bit old, but probably good enough for
	what we want (support compilers who lack them).
	
	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: remove src/support
	from includes. It turns out is was stupid.

1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (install-data-local): forgot a ';'
	(install-data-local): forgot a '\'
	(libinstalldirs): needed after all. reintroduced.

1999-10-13  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): added lyx.spec

	* development/lyx.spec: removed file

	* development/lyx.spec.in: new file

	* po/*.po: merged with lyx.pot becuase of make distcheck
	
	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): added dist-hook so that
	documentation files will be included when doing a make
	dist/distdir/distcheck. Requires cvs export -r HEAD lyxdoc to run.
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): added configure.cmd for now, we can use som
	conditional later.
	more: tried to make install do the right thing, exclude CVS dirs
	etc.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog): reordered som statements so that
	Path would fit in more nicely.

	* all files that used to use pathstack: uses now Path instead.
	This change was a lot easier than expected.
	
	* src/support/path.h: new file

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added path.h

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES): removed pathstack.[Ch]

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (getline): Default arg was given for
	para 3. removed.

	* Configure.cmd: removed file 

1999-10-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/DebugStream.[Ch]: remove the explicit std:: before
	streams classes and types, add the proper 'using' statements when
	MODERN_STL is defined.
	
	* src/debug.h: move the << operator definition after the inclusion
	of DebugStream.h

	* src/support/filetools.C: include "LAssert.h", which is needed
	later. 

	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: add src/support
	to includes. 

	* src/lyxfont.h, src/commandtags.h, src/mathed/math_defs.h:
	include "debug.h" to define a proper ostream.

1999-10-12  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@alstrup.galaxy.dk>

	* src/sys*: Cleaned up the Systemcall stuff a bit. Added "kill(int)"
	  method to the SystemCall class which can kill a process, but it's
	  not fully implemented yet.

	* src/*.C: Changed Systemcalls::Startscript() to startscript()

	* src/support/FileInfo.h: Better documentation	

	* src/lyxfunc.C: Added support for buffer-export html
	
	* src/menus.C: Added Export->As HTML...
	
	* lib/bind/*.bind: Added short-cut for buffer-export html

	* src/lyxrc.*: Added support for new \tth_command
	
	* lib/lyxrc.example: Added stuff for new \tth_command

1999-10-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (IMAGES): removed images/README
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): use this instead of bin_SCRIPTS to that it
	installes in correct place. Check permisions is installed
	correctly.

	* src/LaTeX.C: some no-op changes moved declaration of some
	variables around.

	* src/LaTeX.h (LATEX_H): changed include guard name

1999-10-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: install noweb2lyx.

	* lib/Makefile.am: install configure. 

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: declare a config aux dir; set package
	name to lyx (not sure what the best solution is); generate noweb2lyx.

	* lib/layouts/egs.layout: fix the bibliography layout.

1999-10-08  Jürgen Vigna <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/filetools.C (FileOpenSearch): Fixed a bug where
	when in the PATH was something like /usr/bin;;/bin (note: the ;;)
	it returned without continuing to search the path.
	
1999-10-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Draw): Simplified a gread deal. This
	also fixes a bug. It is not allowed to do tricks with std::strings
	like: string a("hei"); &a[e]; this will not give what you
	think... Any reason for the complexity in this func?

1999-10-06  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* Updated README and INSTALL a bit, mostly to check that my
	CVS rights are correctly set up.

1999-10-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): removed bogus Assert. strlen
	does not allow '\0' chars but lyxstring and std::string does.

1999-10-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* autogen.sh (AUTOCONF): let the autogen script create the
	POTFILES.in file too. POTFILES.in should perhaps now not be
	included in the cvs module.

	* some more files changed to use C++ includes instead of C ones.

	* src/filedlg.C (Reread): fixed a bug wrt Time. It was appended
	not assigned.
	(Reread): added tostr to nlink. buggy output otherwise.
	(Reread): added a string() around szMode when assigning to Buffer,
	without this I got a log of garbled info strings.

	* acconfig.h: commented out the PTR_AS_INT macros. They should not
	be needed.

	* I have added several ostream & operator<<(ostream &, some_type)
	functions. This has been done to avoid casting and warnings when
	outputting enums to lyxerr. This as thus eliminated a lot of
	explicit casts and has made the code clearer. Among the enums
	affected: kb_action, InsetLatexAccent::ACCENT_TYPE, a couple of
	mathed enums, some font enum the Debug::type enum. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.h (clear): missing method. equivalent of
	erase(0, npos).

	* all files that contained "stderr": rewrote constructs that used
	stderr to use lyxerr instead. (except bmtable)

	* src/support/DebugStream.h (level): and the passed t with
	Debug::ANY to avoid spurious bits set.

	* src/debug.h (Debug::type value): made it accept strings of the
	type INFO,INIT,KEY.

	* configure.in (Check for programs): Added a check for kpsewhich,
	the latex generation will use this later to better the dicovery of
	all used files. 

	* src/BufferView.C (create_view): we don't need to cast this to
	(void*) that is done automatically.
	(WorkAreaButtonPress): removed some dead code.

1999-10-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/minibuffer.C (Init): make sure that the "Welcome to LyX!"
	is not overwritten when translated (David Sua'rez de Lis).

	* lib/CREDITS: Added David Sua'rez de Lis

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: setup LYX_DIR correctly in reLyX.

	* src/bufferparams.C (BufferParams): default input encoding is now
	"latin1" 

	* acinclude.m4 (cross_compiling): comment out macro
	LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE. 

	* acconfig.h: make sure that const is not defined (to empty) when
	we are compiling C++. Remove commented out code using SIZEOF_xx
	macros.
	
	* configure.in : move the test for const and inline as late as
	possible so that these C tests do not interefere with C++ ones.
	Remove the call to LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE, since its usefulness
	has not been proven. 

1999-10-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/table.C (getDocBookAlign): remove bad default value for
	isColumn parameter.

	* src/menus.C (ShowFileMenu): add a missing tostr() for lastfiles
	shortcut. 
	(ShowFileMenu2): ditto.

	* lib/reLyX/.cvsignore: add configure and aclocal.m4 to the list
	of files to ignore.

1999-10-04  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Most files: finished the change from the old error code to use
	DebugStream for all lyxerr debugging. Only minor changes remain
	(e.g. the setting of debug levels using strings instead of number) 

1999-10-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/layout.C (Add): Changed to use compare_no_case instead of
	strcasecmp.

	* src/FontInfo.C: changed loop variable type too string::size_type.

1999-10-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/Makefile.am: added -I${srcdir}/../ to INCLUDES and
	set ETAGS_ARGS to --c++ 

1999-09-30  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/table.C (DocBookEndOfCell): commented out two unused variables

	* src/paragraph.C: commented out four unused variables. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TocUpdateCB): moved variable i and added a new i
	insed a if clause with type string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfr1.C (IsSearchStringInText): changed iSrch from int to
	string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): use string::size_type as loop variable.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (ReplaceWord): use string::size_type as loop
	variable, also changed loop to go from 0 to lenght + 1, instead of
	-1 to length. This should be correct.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanError): use string::size_type as loop variable
	type.

	* src/BufferView.C (WorkAreaButtonPress): moved #if 0 up two lines
	(l.896) since y_tmp and row was not used anyway.

	* src/insets/insetref.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Width): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.
	(Draw): use string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (checkContents): use
	string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlabel.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetinfo.C: added an extern for current_view.

	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (scanCommand): use string::size_type
	as loop variable type.

	* most files: removed the RCS tags. With them we had to recompile
	a lot of files after a simple cvs commit. Also we have never used
	them for anything meaningful. 

	* most files: tags-query-replace NULL 0. As adviced several plases
	we now use "0" instead of "NULL" in our code. 

	* src/support/filetools.C (SpaceLess): use string::size_type as
	loop variable type.

1999-09-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C: fixed up some more string stuff.

1999-09-28  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.h: make modestr a std::string.

	* src/filetools.C (GetEnv): made ch really const.

	* src/lyxlib.h: removed the Maximum and Minimum inline functions,
	made code that used these use max/min from <algorithm> instead.

	* changed several c library include files to their equivalent c++
	library include files. All is not changed yet.

	* created a support subdir in src, put lyxstring and lstrings
	there + the extra files atexit, fileblock, strerror. Created
	Makefile.am. edited configure.in and src/Makefile.am to use this
	new subdir. More files moved to support.

	* imported som of the functions from repository lyx, filetools
	
	* ran tags-query-replace on LString -> string, corrected the bogus
	cases. Tried to make use of lstrings.[hC], debugged a lot. There
	is still some errors in there. This is errors where too much or
	too litle get deleted from strings (string::erase, string::substr,
	string::replace), there can also be some off by one errors, or
	just plain wrong use of functions from lstrings. Viewing of quotes
	is wrong. 

	* LyX is now running fairly well with string, but there are
	certainly some bugs yet (see above) also string is quite different
	from LString among others in that it does not allow null pointers
	passed in and will abort if it gets any.
	
	* Added the revtex4 files I forgot when setting up the repository.

1999-09-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* All over: Tried to clean everything up so that only the files
	  that we really need are included in the cvs repository.
	* Switched to use automake.
	* Generaton of reLyX is not perfect, LYX_DIR does not get substituted.
	* Install has not been checked.

1999-09-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* po/pt.po: Three errors:
	       l.533 and l.538 format specification error
	       l. 402 duplicate entry, I just deleted it.
