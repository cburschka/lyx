 	* src/text2.C (InsertStringA): Fix a bug with insertion into table
	
	* src/trans_mgr.C (insertVerbatim): Do not use insetquote when the
	text is Hebrew.
                             
2000-05-27  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/text.C (draw): draw bars under foreign language words.
	
	* src/LColor.[Ch]: add LColor::language
                            
2000-05-27 Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/lyxcursor.h (boundary): New member variable

	* src/text.C (IsBoundary): New methods

	* src/text.C: Use the above for currect cursor movement when there
	is both RTL & LTR text.
	
	* src/text2.C: ditto
	
	* src/bufferview_funcs.C (ToggleAndShow): ditto

2000-05-30  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C (DeleteLineForward): set selection to true to avoid
	that DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism does some magic. This is how it
	is done in all other functions, and seems reasonable.
	(DeleteWordForward): do not jump over non-word stuff, since
	CursorRightOneWord() already does it.
	
	Remove the CHECK tag from DeleteLineForward, DeleteWordForward and
	DeleteWordBackward, since they seem safe to me (since selection is
	set to "true") DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism does nothing.

2000-05-29  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_main.C (easyParse): simplify the code by factoring the
	part that removes parameters from the command line.

	* src/menus.C (Add_to_toc_menu): Limit the number of popups, and
	the number of items per popup.
	(Add_to_refs_menu): Ditto.
	
2000-05-26  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxparagraph.h: renamed ClearParagraph() to
	StripLeadingSpaces() and moved it to paragraph.C. We pass the
	textclass as parameter, and do nothing if free_spacing is
	true. This fixes part of the line-delete-forward problems.

	* src/CutAndPaste.C (cutSelection): use StripLeadingSpaces.
	(pasteSelection): ditto.
	(SwitchLayoutsBetweenClasses): more translatable strings.

	* src/text2.C (CutSelection): use StripLeadingSpaces.
	(PasteSelection): ditto.
	(DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): ditto.

	is not needed in tabular insets.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (TabularFeatures): added missing features.

	(AppendColumn): 
	(AppendRow): implemented this functions
	(cellsturct::operator=): clone the inset too; 

2000-05-23  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (LocalDispatch): better selection support
	when having multicolumn-cells.

2000-05-26  Jose Abilio Oliveira Matos <jamatos@novalis.fc.up.pt>

	Dooteo. 

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_PROG_CXX): use ${CXX} and not g++ to
	get the version.

2000-05-25 Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (RefUpdateCB): disable appropriate buttons when
	there are no labels, or when buffer is readonly.

	* src/menus.C (ShowRefsMenu) disable appropriate menu items when
	there are no labels, buffer is SGML, or when buffer is readonly.

2000-05-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	(LColor): rewore initalization to make compiles go some magnitude
	faster.

	* src/paragraph.C (String): give more correct output.

2000-05-20  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/lyxfont.C (stateText) Do not output the language if it is
	eqaul to the language of the document.

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): Do not put language switch commands
	between two paragraphs with the same language.

	* src/paragraph.C (getParLanguage) Return a correct answer for an
	empty dummy paragraph.

	* src/menus.C (ShowTocMenu): Do not draw lines between LOF/LOT/LOA
	menus.

	* src/menus.C (ShowLayoutMenu) Add "Start of Appendix" item to the
	layout menu.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (init): Try to use helvetica (or fixed) fonts for
	the menus/popup, if requested fonts are unavailable.

2000-05-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettabular.C (LocalDispatch): added some more cursor
	movement support (Up/Down/Tab/Shift-Tab).
	(LocalDispatch): added also preliminari cursor-selection.

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): added SHIFT-Tab as tab-backward.

	* src/paragraph.C (PasteParagraph): Hopefully now right!

	* layouts/hollywood.layout, broadway.layout : move Dialogue to top
	 of list, change all references to Environment to Command
	* tex/hollywood.cls : rewrite environments as commands, add 
	\uppercase to interiorshot and exteriorshot to force uppecase.
	* tex/broadway.cls : rewrite environments as commands. Tweak
	whitespace.

2000-05-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/menus.C (Add_to_toc_menu): fix the code which limits the
	size of items: use a constant intead of the hardcoded 40, and more
	importantly do not remove the %m and %x tags added at the end.
	(Add_to_refs_menu): use vector::size_type instead of
	unsigned int as basic types for the variables. _Please_ do not
	assume that size_t is equal to unsigned int. On an alpha, this is
	unsigned long, which is _not_ the same.

	* src/language.C (initL): remove language "hungarian", since it
	seems that "magyar" is better.

2000-05-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/CutAndPaste.C: hopefully fixed memory the problem defenitively!

	* src/tabular.C (OldFormatRead): added \end_deeper to the end LyXTable
	end markers!

	* src/paragraph.C (PasteParagraph): Possibly a memory leak as
	next was deleted but not set to 0.

	* src/paragraph.C (String): New method.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TocSelectCB,TocUpdateCB): Rewritten.

	* src/lyxvc.C (toggleReadOnly): use VCS::status() instead of stat()

	* src/vc-backend.*: renamed stat() to status() and vcstat to
	vcstatus. It happens that Tru64 Unix 5.0 has stat() as a macro and
	compilation broke. The new name seems more relevant, anyway.

2000-05-17  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/BufferView2.C (removeAutoInsets): fixed use of AutoDeleteInsets
	which was wrong if the removing caused removing of rows!

	* src/lyxlex_pimpl.C (next, nextToken): insert support for pushToken.
	(pushToken): new function.

	visible when before the tabular-inset.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (init): drawLockedFrame was not initialized
	when creating from old insettext.

	* src/tabular.C (Clone): added Clone of text-inset for undo-handling.

2000-05-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/tex/hollywood.cls: better algorithm for page breaks (Garst)

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): redone completely this
	function in a much cleaner way, because of problems when having a
	fixed maxWidth.
	(draw): added a frame border when the inset is locked.
	(SetDrawLockedFrame): this sets if we draw the border or not.
	(SetFrameColor): this sets the frame color (default=insetframe).

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: added x() and y() functions which return
	the top_x and top_baseline values. Added a GetFirstLockingInsetOfType
	function which is needed to see if we have a locking inset of some
	type in this inset (needed for now in insettabular).

	* src/vspace.C (inPixels): the same function also without a BufferView
	parameter as so it is easier to use it in some ocasions.

	* src/lyxfunc.C: changed all places where insertInset was used so
	that now if it couldn't be inserted it is deleted!

	* src/TabularLayout.C: 
	* src/TableLayout.C: added support for new tabular-inset!

	* src/BufferView2.C (insertInset): this now returns a bool if the

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (Latex): use absolute paths for bibtex
	files when LaTeXing a non-nice latex file.

	* src/lyxrc.C (defaultKeyBindings): moved to lyx_main.C 
	several methods: handle override_x_deadkeys.

	* src/lyxrc.h: remove the "bindings" map, which did not make much
	sense anyway. New variable override_x_deadkeys, defaulting to "true".
	
2000-05-09  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (stateText): use a saner method to determine
	whether the font is "default". Seems to fix the crash with DEC
	cxx.

2000-05-05  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/tabular.[Ch]: now using std:vector instead of arrays for all the
	row, columns and cellstructures.

2000-05-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/lyxrc.example: remove obsolete entries.

	* src/buffer.C (parseSingleLyXformat2Token): patch from dekel, fix
	reading of protected_separator for free_spacing.

2000-05-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C (draw): do not display an exclamation mark in the
	margin for margin notes. This is confusing, ugly and
	uninformative. 

	* src/LaTeXFeatures.C (getPackages): load amssymb also when 'Use
	AMS math' is checked.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): do not depend on the textclass
	name to see whether including the amsmath package is needed.

2000-05-05  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	* src/paragraph.C (validate): Compute UsedLanguages correctly
	(don't insert the american language if it doesn't appear in the

	The argument of \thanks{} command is considered moving argument

	* src/paragraph.C (SimpleTeXOnePar): Put \protect before \\ if in
	moving argument.

2000-05-04  Dekel Tsur  <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>

	for appendix/minipage/depth. The lines can be now both in the footnote 
	frame, and outside the frame.

	* src/text.C (SingleWidth,draw): Correct rendering of Hebrew vowels
	points ("nikud")

2000-05-05  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	neede only in tabular.[Ch].

2000-05-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* (various *.C files): add using std::foo directives to please dec

	* src/cheaders/cmath: modified to provide std::abs.

2000-05-04  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C: Prepared all for inserting of multiple
	paragraphs. Still display stuff to do (alignment and other things),
	but I would like to use LyXText to do this when we cleaned out the
	table-support stuff.

	* src/insets/insettabular.C: Changed lot of stuff and added lots
	of functionality still a lot to do.

	* src/tabular.C: Various functions changed name and moved to be
	const functions. Added new Read and Write functions and changed
	lots of things so it works good with tabular-insets (also removed
	some stuff which is not needed anymore * hacks *).

	* src/lyxcursor.h: added operators == and != which just look if
	par and pos are (not) equal.

	* src/buffer.C (latexParagraphs): inserted this function to latex
	all paragraphs form par to endpar as then I can use this too for
	text-insets.

	* src/text2.C (SetLayout): Changed this to use a cursor this is needed
	so that I can call this to from text insets with their own cursor.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): added the output of one \n after the
	output off all paragraphs (because of the fix below)!

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): removed output of \n when we are in

	* src/main.C: added a runtime check that verifies that the xforms
	header used when building LyX and the library used when running

	struct utimbuf times.

	* *: some using changes, use iosfwd instead of the real headers.

	to NEED_MORE_REFRESH. Also don't update cursor position (should be
	done, but perhaps not like this.)

2000-03-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text2.C (InsertStringA): don't forget to insert a META_INSET
	character when inserting an inset.

	done in lyxrc.h.
	
	* src/lyxrc.C: remove double call to defaultKeyBindings

	* src/toolbar.[Ch]: Let the ToolbarDefaults handle the reading of
	toolbar defauls using lyxlex. Remove enums, structs, functions
	related to this. 

	* src/lyxrc.h: use ToolbarDefaults instead of Toolbar for storing
	toolbar defaults. Also store default keybindings in a map.

	* src/ToolbarDefaults.[Ch]: New file. This class is used for
	storing the toolbar defaults without any xforms dependencies. 

	* src/insets/figinset.C: patch posted to list by Andre Poenitz
	applied. Changed to use iterators.

	about each language. Now! Use this new language map enhance it and
	make it really usable for our needs. 

2000-03-09 Dekel Tsur <dekel@math.tau.ac.il>
	
	* screen.C (ShowCursor): Removed duplicate code.

	for Arabic

	* src/lyx_gui.C (init)
	* src/lyxrc.h
	* src/lyxrc.C Added lyxrc command screen_font_encoding_menu. Allows
	to use encoding for menu fonts which is different than the encoding

	do not load the babel package.
	To write an English document with Hebrew/Arabic, change the document
	language to "english".

2000-03-07  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@camel.internal.sylvan.com>

	* lib/layouts/literate-scrap.inc: Fixed initial comment. Now we
	can add multiple spaces in Scrap (literate programming) styles...
	which, by the way, is how I got hooked on LyX to begin with.
 
	* src/mathed/formula.C (Write): Added dummy variable to an
	inset::Latex() call.
	(Latex): Add free_spacing boolean to inset::Latex()

	* src/mathed/formula.h (Latex):	Added free_spacing boolean arg.

 	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
 	
	* src/insets/insettext.C, src/insets/insettext.h (Latex):
 	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
 	
	* src/insets/insetspecialchar.C, src/insets/insetspecialchar.h (Latex):
 	Added free_spacing boolean and made sure that if in a free_spacing
 	paragraph, that we output normal space if there is a protected space.

	Added free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/insets/insetlabel.C, src/insets/insetlabel.h (Latex): Added
	free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h 
	
	* src/insets/insetinfo.C, src/insets/insetinfo.h (Latex):

	free_spacing boolean arg to match inset.h
	
	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): Fix this to
	ignore free_spacing paragraphs. The user's spaces are left
	alone. 
	
	* src/text.C (InsertChar): Fixed the free_spacing layout
	attribute behavior. Now, if free_spacing is set, you can
	add multiple spaces in a paragraph with impunity (and they
	get output verbatim).

	call.
	
	* src/paragraph.C (TeXOnePar): Added dummy args to inset::Latex(...)
	calls.
	
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): Hard-spaces input in free_spacing

	paragraphs.
	
	* src/buffer.C (parseSingleLyXformat2Token): Code to convert
	hard-spaces in the *input* file to simple spaces if the layout
	is free-spacing. This converts old files which had to have
	hard-spaces in free-spacing layouts where a simple space was
	preferrable.
	(writeFileAscii): Added free_spacing check to pass to the newly
	reworked inset::Latex(...) methods. The inset::Latex() code
	ensures that hard-spaces in free-spacing paragraphs get output
	as spaces (rather than "~").
	
2000-03-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>
	
	* src/mathed/math_delim.C (draw): draw the empty placeholder
	delims with a onoffdash line.

	* src/lyxlex.C (printTable): changed to take a ostream as paramter
	and to not flush the stream as often as it used to.

	* src/support/lyxalgo.h: new file 
	(sorted): template function used for checking if a sequence is
	sorted or not. Two versions with and without user supplied
	compare. Uses same compare as std::sort.

	* src/lyxlex.C (LyXLex): check if the table is sorted, if not sort
	it and give warning on lyxerr.
	(pushTable): ditto
	(struct compare_tags): struct with function operators used for
	checking if sorted, sorting and lower_bound.

2000-03-08  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: added owner call which tells us if
	this inset is inside another inset. Changed also the return-type
	of Editable to an enum so it tells clearer what the return-value is.

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): fixed computing of
	textinsets which split automatically on more rows.

	* src/insets/insetert.[Ch]: changed this to be of BaseType
	InsetCollapsable.

	* src/insets/insetfoot.[Ch]: added footnote inset

	* src/insets/insetcollapsable.[Ch]: added this BaseClass for
 	collapsable insets (like footnote, ert, ...)

2000-03-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxdraw.h: remvoe file

	* src/lyxdraw.C: remove file

	* src/insets/insettext.C: added <algorithm>.

2000-03-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_panel.C (delim_cb): case MM_OK use string stream
	(matrix_cb): case MM_OK use string stream

	* src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): case LFUN_SETXY use string
	stream.

	* src/mathed/math_macro.C (draw): use string stream
	(Metrics): use string stream

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXFootnote): for case LyXParagraph::FIG, write
	directly to the ostream.

	* src/vspace.C (asString): use string stream.
	(asString): use string stream
	(asLatexString): use string stream

	* src/lyx_cb.C (UpdateLayoutDocument): use string stream for
	setting Spacing::Other.

	* src/LaTeXFeatures.C (getPackages): use string stream instead of
	sprintf when creating the stretch vale.

	* src/text2.C (alphaCounter): changed to return a string and to
	not use a static variable internally. Also fixed a one-off bug.
	(SetCounter): changed the drawing of the labels to use string
	streams instead of sprintf.

	* src/support/lyxmanip.h: rewrite the newlineanDepth ostream
	manipulator to use a scheme that does not require library support.
	This is also the way it is done in the new GNU libstdc++. Should
	work with DEC cxx now. 

2000-03-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_inset.h (Write(ostream & os): add a space at the
	end. This fixes a bug. 

	* src/mathed (all files concerned with file writing): apply the
	USE_OSTREAM_ONLY changes to mathed too.
	
	* src/support/DebugStream.h: make the constructor explicit.

	* src/lyxfont.C (latexWriteStartChanges): small bug related to
	count and ostream squashed.

2000-03-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_la_SOURCES): add lyxmanip.h.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): add a .c_str(), since
	ostringstream uses STL strings, and we might not.

	* src/insets/insetspecialchar.C: add using directive.
	* src/insets/insettext.C: ditto.

2000-03-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/seminar.layout: feeble attempt at a layout for
	seminar.cls, far from completet and could really use some looking
	at from people used to write layout files.

	* src/support/lyxmanip.h (newlineAndDepth): ostream manipulator to
	use instead of the AddNewlineAndDepth funtion in lyx_cb.C. This is
	a lot nicer and works nicely with ostreams.

	* src/mathed/formula.C (draw): a slightly different solution that
	the one posted to the list, but I think this one works too. (font
	size wrong in headers.)

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): some fiddling on
	Jürgens turf, added some comments that he should read.

	* src/lyxrc.C: remove all traces of RC_NOMENUACCELERATORS, never
	used and it gave compiler warnings.
	RC_SHOW_BANNER + "\\show_banner" added, also to reading and
	writing of lyxrc.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): do the right thing when
	show_banner is true/false.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TimerCB): no need to close or do anything if
	show_banner is false.

	* most file writing files: Now use iostreams to do almost all of
	the writing. Also instead of passing string &, we now use
	stringstreams. mathed output is still not adapted to iostreams.
	This change can be turned off by commenting out all the occurences
	of the "#define USE_OSTREAM_ONLY 1" lines.
	
	* src/WorkArea.C (createPixmap): don't output debug messages.
	(WorkArea): don't output debug messages.

	* lib/lyxrc.example: added a comment about the new variable
	\show_banner 

	* development/Code_rules/Rules: Added some more commente about how
	to build class interfaces and on how better encapsulation can be
	achieved. 

2000-03-03  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insetert.C (InsetERT): Now ERT-insets break row
	automatically with the width of the LyX-Window

	* src/insets/insettext.C (computeTextRows): fixed update bug in
	displaying text-insets (scrollvalues where not initialized!)

2000-03-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): using only res->id ==
	id in the check of the result from lower_bound is not enough since
	lower_bound can return last too, and then res->id will not be a
	valid construct.

	*  all insets and some code that use them: I have conditionalized
	removed the Latex(string & out, ...) this means that only the
	Latex(ostream &, ...) will be used. This is a work in progress to
	move towards using streams for all output of files. 

	* src/text.C (GetColumnNearX): initialize LyXParagraph::size_type
	c to 0.

2000-03-02  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): fix the search
	routine (this fixes bug where greek letters were surrounded by too
	much white space).

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): change a bit the search
	algorithm, to fix bug introduced in 1.1.4. Note that --format is
	no longer passed to kpsewhich, we may have to change that later.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_PROG_CXX): better version-dependent
	warning options to avoid problems with X header files (from Angus
	Leeming).
	* acinclude.m4: regenerated.

2000-03-02  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (WriteParagraphData): Using the
 	par->writeFile() function for writing paragraph-data.
	(Read): Using buffer->parseSingleLyXformat2Token()-function
	for parsing paragraph data!

	* src/buffer.C (readLyXformat2): removed all parse data and using
	the new parseSingleLyXformat2Token()-function.
	(parseSingleLyXformat2Token): added this function to parse (read)
	lyx-file-format (this is called also from text-insets now!)

2000-03-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C (BeginningOfMainBody): initialize previous_char
	and temp.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch(LFUN_MENUSEARCH)): Do the Search dialog
	directly instead of going through a func. One very bad thing: a
	static LyXFindReplace, but I don't know where to place it. 

	* src/lyxfr1.C (GetCurrentSelectionAsString): rewritten to use a
	string instead of char[]. Also changed to static.
	(GetSelectionOrWordAtCursor): changed to static inline
	(SetSelectionOverLenChars): ditto.

	* src/lyxfr0.[Ch] src/lyxfr1.[Ch]: rewrite to get rid of
	current_view and global variables. both classes has changed names
	and LyXFindReplace is not inherited from SearchForm.
	
	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C (CloseAllBufferRelatedPopups): remove the
	fl_form_search form.

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): removed the fl_form_search form.

2000-03-01  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/bind/*.bind: make sure 'buffer-previous' function is not
	bound (from Kayvan).

	* src/insets/Makefile.am (libinsets_la_SOURCES): add BoundingBox.h.

	* lib/layouts/stdletter.inc: fix line spacing in Send_To_Address.

2000-03-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* some things that I should comment but the local pub says head to
	swirly... 
	
	* comment out all code that belongs to the Roff code for Ascii
	export of tables. (this is unused)
	
	* src/LyXView.C: use correct type for global variable
	current_layout. (LyXTextClass::size_type)

	* some code to get the new insetgraphics closer to working I'd be
	grateful for any help.
	
	* src/BufferView2.C (insertInset): use the return type of
	NumberOfLayout properly. (also changes in other files)

	* src/insets/insetspecialchar.[Ch]: add the PROTECTED SEPARATOR to
	this as a test. I want to know what breaks because of this.

	* src/BufferView.[Ch] (tripleClick): name change from trippleClick.

2000-02-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/stdlists.inc: changed the lyxlist latex definition
	to use a \makebox in the label, this allows proper justification
	with out using protected spaces or multiple hfills. Now it is
	"label" for left justified, "\hfill label\hfill" for center, and
	"\hfill label" for right justified. UserGuide.lyx sec. 3.3.6.5
	should be changed accordingly. 

2000-02-28  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxtext.h: change SetLayout() to take a
	LyXTextClass::size_type instead of a char (when there is more than
	127 layouts in a class); also change type of copylayouttype.
	* src/text2.C (SetLayout): ditto.
	* src/LyXView.C (updateLayoutChoice): ditto.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanLogFile): errors where the line number was not
	given just after the '!'-line were ignored (from Dekel Tsur).

	* lib/lyxrc.example: fix description of \date_insert_format

	* lib/layouts/llncs.layout: new layout, contributed by Martin
	Vermeer. 

2000-02-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_PROG_CXX): remove case support for gcc
	2.7.* and add case support for gcc 2.96*. Gcc 2.96 only exists in
	cvs at gcc.gnu.org (currently it fails with ICE on insetbib.C,
	insetindex.C, insetloa.C, insettext.C, filetools.C, BufferView.C,
	BufferView2.C, LyXView.C, buffer.C, lyx_cb.C, lyxfunc.C,
	paragraph.C, text.C, text2.C)

2000-02-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insettext.C (LocalDispatch): remove extra break
	statement. 

	* src/insets/insetert.[Ch] (Clone): change return value to Inset*
	* src/insets/insettext.[Ch] (Clone): change return value to Inset*

	InsetCitation::Holder in public space.

2000-02-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insettext.h: small change to get the new files from
	Juergen to compile (use "string", not "class string").

	* src/insets/insettext.[Ch], src/insets/insertert.[Ch]: use string
	const & as parameter to LocalDispatch, use LyXFont const & as
	paramter to some other func. This also had impacto on lyxinsets.h
	and the two mathed insets.

2000-02-24  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/buffer.C:
	* src/commandtags.h: 
	* src/LyXAction.C:
	* src/lyxfunc.C: added code for LFUN_INSET_ERT and LFUN_INSET_TEXT

	* src/BufferView.h
	* src/BufferView.C

	* src/insets/inset.C (LocalDispatch): changed arg parameter to string
	as it is in lyxfunc.C now

	* src/insets/lyxinset.h: Added functions for text-insets

2000-02-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C src/UpdateInset.[Ch]: move the updateinsetlist into
	BufferView and reimplement the list as a queue put inside its own
	class.

	* src/bufferlist.[Ch] (updateInset): remove func, not needed.

	* several files: use the new interface to the "updateinsetlist"
	
	* src/WorkArea.C (work_area_handler): call BufferView::doubleClick
	on doubleclick.
	(work_area_handler): call BufferView::trippleClick on trippleclick.

	* src/BufferView.C (doubleClick): new function, selects word on
	doubleclick. 
	(trippleClick): new function, selects line on trippleclick.

2000-02-22  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/bind/xemacs.bind: buffer-previous not supported

2000-02-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/insets/insettoc.[Ch] (LinuxDoc, DocBook): mark the methods

	here from text.C

	* src/paragraph.C (getParDirection): move this function here from
	text.C 
	(getLetterDirection): ditto
	
2000-02-18  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* WorkArea, Painter, LyXScreen: Fixed the crash that occured on
	resize due to wrong pixmap beeing used. Also took the opurtunity
	to make the LyXScreen stateless on regard to WorkArea and some
	general cleanup in the same files.

	missing ones.
	
	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (draw): draw Editable as buttons.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (draw): make the accents draw
	better, at present this will only work well with iso8859-1.
	
	* several files: remove the old drawing code, now we use the new
	painter only.

	* several files: remove support for mono_video, reverse_video and
	fast selection.

2000-02-17  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/mathed/math_cursor.[Ch] (SelGetArea): Changed form int * to
	int ** as we have to return the pointer, otherwise we have only
	NULL pointers in the returning function.

2000-02-16  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/LaTeX.C (operator()): quote file name when running latex.

2000-02-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/toolbar.C (set): use fl_set_object_helper for the tooltop
	(bubble tip), this removes our special handling of this.

	* Remove all code that is unused now that we have the new
	workarea. (Code that are not active when NEW_WA is defined.)

	* Make the uses of XSync not conditionalized on define USE_XSYNC.
	
2000-02-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): fix LFUN_LAYOUT when giving a
	nonexisting layout; correctly redirect obsoleted layouts.

	* lib/lyxrc.example: document \view_dvi_paper_option

	* src/lyxrc.[Ch]: add support for the \view_dvi_paper_option
	variable. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (RunScript): handle $$FName for command names. 
	(PreviewDVI): handle the view_dvi_paper_option variable.
	[Both from Roland Krause]

2000-02-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	char const *, int, LyXFont)
	(text(int, int, string, LyXFont)): ditto 

	* src/text.C (InsertCharInTable): attempt to fix the double-space
	feature in tables too.
	(BackspaceInTable): ditto.
	(GetVisibleRow): make bottom pagebreak line be a onoff line.

2000-02-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (owner): only complain if owner_ is set and bv != 0

	* src/BufferView.C (resizeCurrentBuffer): set the owner of the
	newly found text in textcache to this.
	(buffer): set the owner of the text put into the textcache to 0

	* src/insets/figinset.C (draw): fixed the drawing of figures with
	the new Painter.

	* src/text.C src/mathed/math_cursor.C: nailed and fixed the
	drawing of mathframe, hfills, protected space, table lines. I have
	now no outstanding drawing problems with the new Painter code. 

2000-02-11  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/PainterBase.C (ellipse, circle): do not specify the default
	arguments. 

	* src/LColor.h: add using directive.

	* src/Painter.[Ch]: change return type of methods from Painter& to
	PainterBase&. Add a using directive.

	* src/WorkArea.C: wrap xforms callbacks in C functions
	C_WorkArea_xxx. 

	* lib/layouts/foils.layout: font fix and simplifications from Carl
	Ollivier-Gooch.

2000-02-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* a lot of files: The Painter, LColor and WorkArea from the old
	devel branch has been ported to lyx-devel. Some new files and a
	lot of #ifdeffed code. The new workarea is enabled by default, but
	if you want to test the new Painter and LColor you have to compile
	with USE_PAINTER defined (do this in config.h f.ex.) There are
	still some rought edges, and I'd like some help to clear those
	out. It looks stable (loads and displays the Userguide very well).
	

2000-02-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/buffer.C (pop_tag): revert to the previous implementation
	(use a global variable for both loops).

	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): make combo box taller (from Dekel
	Tsur). 

	* src/toolbar.C (set): ditto
	* src/insets/insetbib.C (create_form_citation_form): ditto

	* lib/CREDITS: added Dekel Tsur.

	* lib/kbd/hebrew.kmap, lib/kbd/null.kmap,
	lib/layouts/heb-article.layout, lib/layouts/heb-letter.layout: new
	hebrew supports files from Dekel Tsur.
	
	* lib/kbd/iso8859-8.cdef: new file, from Tzafrir Cohen
	<tzafrir@technion.ac.il> 

	* src/lyxrc.C: put \date_insert_format at the right place.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): fix the handling of
	BufferParams::sides when writing out latex files.

	* src/BufferView2.C: add a "using" directive.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C (sum): when we use lyxstring,
	ostringstream::str needs an additional .c_str().

2000-02-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.C (ChangeExtension): patch from Etienne
	applied.

	with hebrew.

2000-02-04  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: rework to be more flexible.
	
	* several places: don't check if a pointer is 0 if you are going
	to delete it.

	* src/text.C: remove some dead code.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: remove some dead code
	
	* src/buffer.C: move the BufferView funcs to BufferView2.C

	made some member funcs const

	* src/kbmap.C: use a std::list to store the bindings in.
	
	* src/BufferView2.C: new file

	* src/kbsequence.[Ch]: new files
	
	* src/LyXAction.C + others: remove all trace of buffer-previous
	
	* src/Bullet.[Ch]: moved ITEMIZE_DEFAULTS inside Bullet.C so that we
	only have one copy in the binary of this table.
	
	* hebrew patch: moved some functions from LyXText to more
	appropriate places. (LyXParagraph, BufferParams, LyXFont)
	
	* several files: remove support for XForms older than 0.88
	whitespace changes.
	remove some #if 0 #endif code
	
	* src/TextCache.[Ch]: new file. Holds the textcache.

	* src/BufferView.C: changes to use the new TextCache interface.
	(waitForX): remove the now unused code.
	
	* src/BackStack.h: remove some commented code

	* lib/bind/emacs.bind: remove binding for buffer-previous

2000-02-03  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* applied the hebrew patch.

	* src/lyxrow.h: make sure that all Row variables are initialized.

	* src/text2.C (TextHandleUndo): comment out a delete, this might
	introduce a memory leak, but should also help us to not try to
	read freed memory. We need to look at this one.

	* src/paragraph.C (SimpleDocBookOneTablePar): initialize column to 0
	(LyXParagraph): initalize footnotekind.

	* src/lyxrc.C (output): added case RC_DATE_INSERT_FORMAT. Jug
	forgot this when applying the patch. Please heed the warnings.

	* src/BufferView.C (buffer): a fix for the buffer-reload problem
	(aka. reformat problem)

	* src/bufferlist.C (exists): made const, and use const_iterator
	(isLoaded): new func.
	(release): use std::find to find the correct buffer.

	* src/bufferlist.h: made getState a const func.
	made empty a const func.
	made exists a const func.
	new func: isLoaded

2000-02-01  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/lyxfunc.C lyxrc.C: changed from insert-date to date-insert

	* po/it.po: updated a bit the italian po file and also changed the
	'file nuovo' for newfile to 'filenuovo' without a space, this did
	annoy me a lot :)
	
	* src/lyxrc.C (LyXRC): added support for a default insert_date_format
	for the new insert_date command.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): added support for a insert_date function
	from jdblair, to insert a date into the current text conforming to
	a strftime format (for now only considering the locale-set and not
	the document-language).

2000-01-28  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (textWidth): hopefully better fix for the Array
	Bounds Read error seen by purify. The problem was that islower is
	a macros which takes an unsigned char and uses it as an index for
	in array of characters properties (and is thus subject to the
	above error).
	(drawText): ditto.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (UpdateLayoutDocument): use a switch to set
	correctly the paper sides radio buttons.
	(UpdateDocumentButtons): ditto.

2000-01-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/kbmap.C (getsym + others): change to return unsigned int,
	returning a long can give problems on 64 bit systems. (I assume
	that int is 32bit on 64bit systems)

2000-01-27  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): fix a the buffer returned by
	LyXLookupString to be zero-terminated. Really fixes problems seen
	by purify, I think.

2000-01-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): "fix" so that we never try to
	write a (char*)0 to the lyxerr stream.

	* src/lastfiles.C: move algorithm before the using statemets.

2000-01-26  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lastfiles.C: move using directives in global scope (egcs 1.x
	complains otherwise).
	* src/table.C: ditto

	* lib/reLyX/reLyX.in: use variable @LYX_DIR@ as built-in data
	directory. 

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in (LYX_DIR): re-introduce this variable
	that I removed earlier... It is really needed.

	* lib/examples/multicol.lyx: new file, splitted from Extended.lyx. 

2000-01-25  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* INSTALL: update xforms home page URL.

	* lib/configure.m4: fix a bug with unreadable layout files.

	* src/table.C (calculate_width_of_column): add "using std::max"
	directive. 

2000-01-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* several files: marked several lines with "DEL LINE", this is
	lines that can be deleted without changing anything.
	if (<ptr>) // DEL LINE  /* this line is _never_ needed. Delete
	                           checks this anyway */
	        delete <ptr>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C: Changed some debugs to Debug::KEY

	* src/DepTable.C (update): add a "+" at the end when the checksum
	is different. (debugging string only)

	* src/paragraph.C (ReturnNextInsetPointer): fix bug that caused
	the next inset to not be displayed. This should also fix the list
	of labels in the "Insert Crossreference" dialog.

2000-01-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/LSubstring.C (LSubstring): set pos to string::npos
	when regex was not found.

	* src/support/lstrings.C (lowercase): use handcoded transform always.
	(uppercase): ditto

	* src/text.C (Delete): fixed the crash. cursor.par->prev and
	old_cursor.par->prev could be 0.

	* several files: changed post inc/dec to pre inc/dec
	
	* src/lastfiles.C (writeFile): use ostream_iterator and copy to
	write the lastfiles to file.

	* src/BufferView.C (buffer): only show TextCache info when debugging
	(buffer): ditto
	(resizeCurrentBuffer): ditto
	(workAreaExpose): ditto

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-7.cdef: changed to new quoting scheme

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-2.cdef: changed to new quoting scheme

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): make the display of UMLAUT
	a bit better by removing the special case for \i and \j.

2000-01-24  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_main.C (easyParse): remove test for bad comand line
	options, since this broke all xforms-related parsing.

	* src/kbmap.C (getsym): set return type to unsigned long, as
	declared in header. On an alpha, long is _not_ the same as int.

	* src/support/LOstream.h: add a "using std::flush;"

	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto.

2000-01-21  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): use blinding fast file copy instead of
	"a char at a time", now we are doing it the C++ way.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: get rid of struct pidwaitpit, use a
	std::list<int> instead.
	(addpidwait): reflect move to std::list<int>
	(sigchldchecker): ditto

	* src/bmtable.c (fl_set_bmtable_file): have arguments in the X r5
	version also. 

	* src/paragraph.C (FirstPhysicalPar): remove assert and comment
	that obviously was wrong...

	* src/lyxfont.C (textWidth): have c as char c[2] instead of char
	c, this avoids warnings with purify and islower.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: rename struct queue to struct
	queue_element and rewrite to use a std::queue. gsqueue is now a
	std::queue<queue_element>
	(runqueue): reflect move to std::queue
	(addwait): ditto

	* src/support/lstrings.h (tostr): specialize for bool, otherwise
	we would get "1" "0" instead of "true" "false. Also make the tostr
	functions inline.

2000-01-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/buffer.C (writeFileAscii): Disabled code for special groff
	handling of tabulars till I fix this in table.C

2000-01-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/mkdir.C (mkdir): change second argument of mkdir to
	unsigned long int.
	* src/support/lyxlib.h: ditto.

2000-01-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): make accents on top of 'i'
	and 'j' look better. This might fix the "macron" bug that has been
	observed.

	* src/support/lstrings.[Ch] (tostr): reimplement all the tostr
	functions as one template function. Delete the old versions.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: move using std::ifstream inside
	MODERN_STL_STREAMS

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_la_SOURCES): added mkdir.C
	and putenv.C

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.C: delete #include "bufferlist.h" never used

	* src/mathed/formula.C: delete #include "bufferlist.h" never used

	* src/insets/figinset.C (InitFigures): use new instead of malloc
	to allocate memory for figures and bitmaps.
	(DoneFigures): use delete[] instead of free to deallocate memory
	for figures and bitmaps.
	(runqueue): use new to allocate 
	(getfigdata): use new/delete[] instead of malloc/free
	(RegisterFigure): ditto

	* some files: moved some declarations closer to first use, small
	whitespace changes use preincrement instead of postincrement where
	it does not make a difference.
	
	* src/kbmap.[Ch]: delete code according to define NO_HASH, it is a
	step on the way to use stl::containers for key maps. 

	* src/bufferlist.h: add a typedef for const_iterator and const
	versions of begin and end.

	* src/bufferlist.[Ch]: change name of member variable _state to
	state_. (avoid reserved names)
	(makePup): removed
	(getFileNames): returns the filenames of the buffers in a vector.

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): added ro

	* src/support/putenv.C: new file

	* src/support/mkdir.C: new file

2000-01-20  Allan Rae <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/layouts/IEEEtran.layout: Added several theorem environments

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: Example theorem environments and a
	couple of minor additions.

	* lib/doc/LaTeXConfig.lyx.in:  Use URL insets for ftp sites 
	(except for those in footnotes of course)

2000-01-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxlookup.C (CloseLyXLookup): set xic=0; after destruction. 

	* src/mathed/math_utils.C (MathedLookupBOP): rewrite to use
	std::sort and std::lower_bound instead of qsort and handwritten
	binarysearch.
	(struct compara): struct that holds the functors used by std::sort
	and std::lower_bound in MathedLookupBOP.

2000-01-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/LAssert.h: do not do partial specialization. We do
	not really need it.

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: note that lyx::getUserName() and
	lyx::date() are not in use right now. Should these be suppressed?

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): we do not need the user name here.
	(makeLinuxDocFile): do not put date and user name in linuxdoc
	headers. 

	* src/support/lyxlib.h (kill): change first argument to long int,
	since that's what solaris uses.

	* src/support/kill.C (kill): fix declaration to match prototype.

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_NAMESPACES): fix the macro to
	actually check whether namespaces are supported. This is not what
	it used to do.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C: add a using directive.

2000-01-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/kill.C: if we have namespace support we don't have
	to include lyxlib.h.

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: use namespace lyx if supported.

2000-01-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/date.C: new file

	* src/support/chdir.C: new file

	* src/support/getUserName.C: new file

	* src/support/getcwd.C: new file

	* src/support/abort.C: new file

	* src/support/kill.C: new file

	* src/support/lyxlib.h: moved all the functions in this file
	insede struct lyx. Added also kill and abort to this struct. This
	is a way to avoid the "kill is not defined in <csignal>", we make
	C++ wrappers for functions that are not ANSI C or ANSI C++.

	* src/support/lyxsum.C (sum): use #ifdef MODERN_STL_STREAMS
	instead of #if __GLIBCPP__. Since lyxsum is now put inside struct
	lyx it has been renamed to sum.

2000-01-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/text.C: add using directives for std::min and std::max.

2000-01-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/texrow.C (getIdFromRow): actually return something useful in
	id and pos. Hopefully fixes the bug with positionning of errorbox
	insets. 

	* src/lyx_main.C (easyParse): output an error and exit if an
	incorrect command line option has been given.

	* src/spellchecker.C (ispell_check_word): document a memory leak.

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): fix mismatched allocation/deletion,
	where a "struct utimbuf" is allocated with "new" and deleted with
	"delete[]". 

2000-01-13  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (CutSelection): don't delete double spaces.
	(PasteSelection): ditto
	(CopySelection): ditto
	
	* src/text.C (Backspace): don't delete double spaces.

	* src/lyxlex.C (next): fix a bug that were only present with
	conformant std::istream::get to read comment lines, use
	std::istream::getline instead. This seems to fix the problem.

2000-01-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): fix for the "not
	allowed to insert space before space" editing problem. Please read
	commends at the beginning of the function. Comments about usage
	are very welcome.

	* src/text.C (InsertChar): fix for the "not allowed to insert
	space before space" editing problem.

	* src/text2.C (DeleteEmptyParagraphMechanism): when
	IsEmptyTableRow can only return false this last "else if" will
	always be a no-op. Commented out.

	* src/text.C (RedoParagraph): As far as I can understand tmp
	cursor is not really needed.

	* src/lyxtext.[Ch] (IsEmptyTableCell): commented out. As used at
	present it could only return false anyway. 
	(several functions): Did something not so smart...added a const
	specifier on a lot of methods.
	
	* src/paragraph.C (BreakParagraph): removed the tmp->text.reserve
	and add a tmp->text.resize. The LyXParagraph constructor does the
	resize for us.
	(BreakParagraphConservative): ditto

	* src/support/path.h (Path): add a define so that the wrong usage
	"Path("/tmp") will be flagged as a compilation error:
	"`unnamed_Path' undeclared (first use this function)"

2000-01-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* config/lyxinclude.m4 (LYX_FUNC_PUTENV_ARGTYPE): fix the macro,
	which was bogus for several reasons.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanAux): fix the regular expression used to scan
	.aux files. 
	(runBibTeX): ditto.

	* autogen.sh: do not use "type -path" (what's that anyway?).

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): remove extraneous space
	which caused a kpsewhich warning (at least with kpathsea version
	3.0). 

2000-01-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): use .la

	* src/insets/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): use .la

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): switch back to .la libs

2000-01-11  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/paragraph.C (BreakParagraph): do not reserve space on text
	if we don't need to (otherwise, if pos_end < pos, we end up
	reserving huge amounts of memory due to bad unsigned karma).
	(BreakParagraphConservative): ditto, although I have not seen
	evidence the bug can happen here.

	* src/lyxparagraph.h: add a using std::list.

2000-01-11  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/menus.C (MenuDocu): output an Alert if the documentation-file
	could not be found.

2000-01-11  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/vc-backend.C (doVCCommand): change to be static and take one
	more parameter: the path to chdir too be fore executing the command.
	(retrive): new function equiv to "co -r"

	* src/bufferlist.C (loadLyXFile): implement the missing parts if
	file_not_found_hook is true.

	* src/lyxvc.C (file_not_found_hook): implement file_not_found_hook.

	* src/support/filetools.C (IsFileWriteable): use FileInfo to check
	if a file is readwrite,readonly...anything else.

2000-01-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MakeLaTeXOutput): name change from MakeDVIOutput
	(CreatePostscript): name change from MenuRunDVIPS (or something)
	(PreviewPostscript): name change from MenuPreviewPS
	(PreviewDVI): name change from MenuPreviewDVI

	* lib/lyxrc.example: added \pdflatex_command, \pdf_mode,
	\view_pdf_command., \pdf_to_ps_command

	* lib/configure.m4: added search for PDF viewer, and search for
	PDF to PS converter. 
	(lyxrc.defaults output): add \pdflatex_command,
	\view_pdf_command and \pdf_to_ps_command.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuPreviewDVI): renamed from MenuPreview.

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): we don't use blocksize for anything so
	I removed it.

2000-01-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/block.h: disable operator T* (), since it causes
	problems with both compilers I tried. See comments in the file.

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: do not define LYX_DIR. support flag
	--with-lyxname. 

	* lib/reLyX/reLyX.in: change LYX_DIR to pkgdatadir; change env.
	variable LYX_DIR_10x to LYX_DIR_11x.

	* src/Makefile.am: replace variable LYX_DIR with pkgdatadir.

	* INSTALL: document --with-lyxname.
	* NEWS: ditto.

	* configure.in: new configure flag --with-lyxname which allows to
	choose the name under which lyx is installed. Default is "lyx", of
	course. It used to be possible to do this with --program-suffix,
	but the later has in fact a different meaning for autoconf.

	* src/support/lstrings.h (lstrchr): reformat a bit.

	* src/lyxlex.h: include LIstream.h, for Sun CC this time.
	* src/mathed/math_defs.h: ditto.

2000-01-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyxrc.[Ch]: New tag and variable "\make_backup". Defaults to
	true, decides if we create a backup file or not when saving. New
	tag and variable \pdf_mode, defaults to false. New tag and
	variable \pdflatex_command, defaults to pdflatex. New tag and
	variable \view_pdf_command, defaults to xpdf. New tag and variable
	\pdf_to_ps_command, defaults to pdf2ps.

2000-01-08  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/bufferlist.C (close): don't call insetUnlock if the buffer
	does not have a BufferView.
	(unlockInset): ditto + don't access the_locking_inset if the
	buffer does not have a BufferView.

	* src/LyXView.C (KeyPressMask_raw_callback): add a XSync in
	certain circumstances so that we don't continue a keyboard
	operation long after the key was released. Try f.ex. to load a
	large document, press PageDown for some seconds and then release
	it. Before this change the document would contine to scroll for
	some time, with this change it stops imidiatly.

	* src/support/block.h: don't allocate more space than needed. As
	long as we don't try to write to the arr[x] in a array_type arr[x]
	it is perfectly ok. (if you write to it you might segfault).
	added operator value_type*() so that is possible to pass the array
	to functions expecting a C-pointer.

	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): don't fail completely if unable to
	cvs.

	* intl/*: updated to gettext 0.10.35, tried to add our own
	required modifications. Please verify.

	* po/*: updated to gettext 0.10.35, tried to add our own required
	modifications. Please verify.
	
	* src/support/lstrings.C (tostr): go at fixing the problem with
	cxx and stringstream. When stringstream is used return
	oss.str().c_str() so that problems with lyxstring and basic_string
	are avoided. Note that the best solution would be for cxx to use
	basic_string all the way, but it is not conformant yet. (it seems)

	* src/lyx_cb.C + other files: moved several global functions to
	class BufferView, some have been moved to BufferView.[Ch] others
	are still located in lyx_cb.C. Code changes because of this. (part
	of "get rid of current_view project".)

	* src/buffer.C + other files: moved several Buffer functions to
	class BufferView, the functions are still present in buffer.C.
	Code changes because of this.

	* config/lcmessage.m4: updated to most recent. used when creating
	acinclude.m4.

	* config/progtest.m4: updated to most recent. used when creating
	acinclude.m4.
	
	* config/gettext.m4: updated to most recent. applied patch for
	tmplinguas.

	* config/gettext.m4.patch: new file that shows what changes we
	have done to the local copy of gettext.m4.

	* config/libtool.m4: new file, used in creation of acinclude.m4

	* config/lyxinclude.m4: new file, this is the lyx created m4
	macros, used in making acinclude.m4.
	
	* autogen.sh: GNU m4 discovered as a separate task not as part of
	the lib/configure creation. 
	Generate acinlucde from files in config. Actually cat
	lyxinclude.m4, libtool.m4 and gettext.m4 together. This makes it
	easier to upgrade .m4 files that really are external.

	* src/Spacing.h: moved using std::istringstream to right after
	<sstream>. This should fix the problem seen with some compilers.

2000-01-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C: began some work to remove the dependency a lot of
	functions have on BufferView::text, even if not really needed.
	(GetCurrentTextClass): removed this func, it only hid the
	current_view. 

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_DEPENDENCIES): use support/libsupport.la I
	forgot this in last commit.

	* src/Bullet.C (bulletEntry): use static char const *[] for the
	tables, becuase of this the return arg had to change to string.
	(bulletSize): ditto
	(~Bullet): removed unneeded destructor

	* src/BufferView.C (beforeChange): moved from lyx_cb.C
	(insetSleep): moved from Buffer
	(insetWakeup): moved from Buffer
	(insetUnlock): moved from Buffer

	* buffer.[Ch], BufferView.[Ch] + others: moved the_locking_inset
	from Buffer to BufferView.
	
	* acinclude.m4: include libtool.m4 from libtool 1.3.4.

	* config/ltmain.sh: updated to version 1.3.4 of libtool

	* config/ltconfig: updated to version 1.3.4 of libtool

2000-01-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>


	* src/buffer.C (pop_tag): fix a dubious for() loop initialization.
	Did I get that right?

	* src/lyxlex.h: add a "using" directive or two.
	* src/Spacing.h: ditto.
	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto.
	* src/support/filetools.C: ditto.
	* src/support/lstrings.C: ditto.
	* src/BufferView.C: ditto.
	* src/bufferlist.C: ditto.
	* src/lyx_cb.C: ditto.
	* src/lyxlex.C: ditto.

	* NEWS: add some changes for 1.1.4.
	
2000-01-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/BufferView.C: first go at a TextCache to speed up switching
	between documents.

2000-01-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/examples/ItemizeBullets.lyx: update from Tino Meinen. 
	* lib/examples/nl_voorbeeld_ruw.lyx: ditto.
	* lib/examples/nl_voorbeeld_verlyxt.lyx: ditto.
	* lib/examples/nl_opsommingstekens.lyx: new translation from Tino
	Meinen.
	
	* src/mathed/math_defs.h (MathedRowSt): make sure that all
	members of the struct are correctly initialized to 0 (detected by
	purify) 
	* src/lyxrc.C (LyXRC): ditto for print_adapt_output.
	* src/insets/figinset.C (InsetFig): ditto for pswid and pshgh.

	* src/insets/figinset.C (sigchldchecker): use "delete" to free a
	pidwait, since it was allocated with "new". This was potentially
	very bad. Thanks to Michael Schmitt for running purify for us.


2000-01-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C: add a 'using std::make_pair;' statement.

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.h: add a 'using std::pair;' statement.

1999-12-30  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: minor change

	* src/lyxvc.C (registrer, checkIn), src/lyx_cb.C (MenuInsertLabel),
	src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): askForText changes

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.[Ch] (askForText): now returns a bool also so we 
	know when a user has cancelled input. Fixes annoying problems with
	inserting labels and version control.

1999-12-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lstrings.C (tostr): rewritten to use strstream and
	stringstream

1999-12-28  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.C (IsFileWriteable): use fstream to check
	(IsDirWriteable): use fileinfo to check

	* src/support/filetools.h (FilePtr): whole class deleted

	* src/insets/figinset.C (GetPSSizes): rewritten to use ifstream.

	* src/lyxparagraph.h (readSimpleWholeFile): make arg istream

	* src/lyx_cb.C (InsertAsciiFile): use ifstream instead of FilePtr

	* src/bufferlist.C (write): use ifstream and ofstream instead of
	FILE*

	* src/Spacing.h: use istrstream instead of sscanf

	* src/mathed/math_defs.h: change first arg to istream from FILE*

	* src/buffer.C (insertLyXFile): use ifstream instead of FilePtr

	* src/mathed/math_parser.C: have yyis to be an istream 
	(LexGetArg): use istream (yyis)
	(yylex): ditto
	(mathed_parse): ditto

	(setFile): open an filebuf and assign that to a istream instead of
	using FILE*
	(setStream): new function, takes an istream as arg. 
	(setFile): deleted function
	(EatLine): rewritten us use istream instead of FILE*
	(next): ditto
	(nextToken): ditto

	* src/table.C (LyXTable): use istream instead of FILE*
	(Read): rewritten to take an istream instead of FILE*

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): remove an extraneous break statement.

	* src/support/filetools.C (QuoteName): change to do simple
	'quoting'. More work is necessary. Also changed to do nothing
	under emx (needs fix too).
	(Putenv): Cast the argument of putenv() with PUTENV_TYPE_ARG.

	* acinclude.m4 (STL_STRING_FWD_H_LOCATION): add the comment for
	config.h.in to the AC_DEFINE_UNQUOTED() call.
	(LYX_FUNC_PUTENV_ARGTYPE): new macro. Checks whether putenv()
	needs char * as argument (because Solaris 7 declares it like
	that). 

	* acconfig.h: remove placeholder for STL_STRING_FWD_H_LOCATION;
	remove definition of BZERO.

1999-12-24  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/LRegex.C: include <regex.h> if HAVE_REGEX_H is
	defined, "lyxregex.h" if not.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): changed from
	pkglib_ to noinst_

	* src/mathed/Makefile.am (noinst_LTLIBRARIES): changed from
	pkglib_ to noinst_

	* src/buffer.C (getBibkeyList): pass the parameter delim to
	InsetInclude::getKeys and InsetBibtex::getKeys.

	* src/insets/insetinclude.[Ch] (getKeys): add parameter delim, which
	is passed to Buffer::getBibkeyList
	
	* src/insets/insetbib.[Ch] (getKeys): add parameter delim, and use it
	instead of the hardcoded comma.

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (getKeys): make sure that there are not
	leading blanks in bibtex keys. Normal latex does not care, but
	harvard.sty seems to dislike blanks at the beginning of citation
	keys. In particular, the retturn value of the function is

	* INSTALL: make it clear that libstdc++ is needed and that gcc
	2.7.x probably does not work.

	* src/support/filetools.C (findtexfile): make debug message go to
	the LATEX channel
	* src/insets/insetbib.C (getKeys): ditto

	* src/debug.C (showTags): make sure that the output is correctly

	configure.in or acinclude.m4.

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): headers of latex file also changed
	to avoid user name, date and copyright.

1999-12-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/table.C (Read): Now read bogus row format informations
		if the format is < 5 so that afterwards the table can
		be read by lyx but without any format-info. Fixed the
		crash we experienced when not doing this.

1999-12-21  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	iterators to fill the choice_class.
	(updateLayoutChoice): rewritten to use iterators to fill the
	layoutlist in the toolbar.

	* src/BufferView.h (BufferView::work_area_width): removed unused
	variable. 

	* src/lyx_gui_misc.C (WarnReadonly): added string parameter 'file'

	* src/buffer.C (sgmlOpenTag): drop the use of the static space array
	(sgmlCloseTag): ditto

	* src/support/lstrings.h: return type of countChar changed to
	unsigned char.

	* src/support/lstrings.C (countChar): use HAVE_STD_COUNT to choose
	what version of this func to use. Also made to return unsigned int.

	* configure.in: call LYX_STD_COUNT 

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_STD_COUNT): new function checks for a standard
	conforming std::count. 

1999-12-20  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_draw.C (Draw, Metrics): fix a bug where a prime
	and a subscript would give bad display (patch from Dekel Tsur
	<dekel@math.tau.ac.il>). 

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.h: make sure ACCENT_TYPES is public. 

	* src/spellchecker.C (create_ispell_pipe): use a const_cast to

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): check that LFUN_UNKNOWN_ACTION is not
	triggered when no buffer is active

	* src/layout.C: removed `break' after `return' in switch(), since
	it is unreachable.

	* src/lyx_main.C (init): make sure LyX can be ran in place even
	when libtool has done its magic with shared libraries. Fix the
	test for the case when the system directory has not been found.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeLaTeX): make sure to keep the full path
	name for the latex file.
	(MenuMakeHTML): ditto

	* src/buffer.h: add an optional boolean argument, which is passed
	to ChangeExtension.

1999-12-20  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx: small correction and update.

	* configure.in: Attempted to use LYX_PATH_HEADER

 	* src/stl_string_fwd.h: Don't need HAVE_STL_STRING_FWD_H anymore

	* acconfig.h, acinclude.m4 (LYX_STL_STRING_FWD): totally revised after
 	input from JMarc.  Now use preprocessor to find the header.
 	Also stopped making HAVE_STL_STRING_FWD_H and extended the comments.
	(LYX_PATH_HEADER): My, so far, failed attempt to generalize
 	LYX_STL_STRING_FWD.  See comments in file.	

1999-12-19  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* The global MiniBuffer * minibuffer variable is dead.
	
	* The global FD_form_main * fd_form_main variable is dead.

1999-12-17  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/toolbar.C (set): condition #warning on WITH_WARNINGS

	* src/table.h: add the LOstream.h header
	* src/debug.h: ditto
	
	* src/LyXAction.h: change the explaination of the ReadOnly
	attribute: is indicates that the function _can_ be used.

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): find-replace _can_ be used in read-only
	mode. 

1999-12-16  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxfont.C (ascent): Make sure that char is _always_ used as
	unsigned. 
	(descent): ditto
	(lbearing): ditto
	(rbearing): ditto

	* src/paragraph.C (GetWord): assert on pos>=0
	(GetChar): ditto
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the use of an invariant on
	ENABLE_ASSERTIONS 
	* src/support/lyxstring.h: ditto

	* src/Bullet.[Ch]: replace DEBUG_AS_DEFAULT by ENABLE_ASSERTIONS.
	Use LAssert.h instead of plain assert().

	* src/support/lstrings.h: add LAssert.h, in case it is needed.

	* src/lyxfunc.C: do not include LAssert.h, it is not used.
	* src/support/filetools.C: ditto

	* src/support/LAssert.h: make Assert a no-op if ENABLE_ASSERTIONS
	is not defined. 

	* INSTALL: document the new configure flags
	
	* configure.in: suppress --with-debug; add --enable-assertions

	* acinclude.m4: various changes in alignment of help strings.

1999-12-16  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/kbmap.C: commented out the use of the hash map in kb_map,
	beginning of movement to a stl::container. 

	* several files: removed code that was not in effect when
	MOVE_TEXT was defined.
	
	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: removed bogus backslashes. Backslashes
	for escaping should not be used. We can discuss if the string
	should be enclosed in f.ex. [] instead of "".

	* src/trans_mgr.C (insert): use the new returned value from
	encodeString to get deadkeys and keymaps done correctly.

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): changed to return a pair, to tell
	what to use if we know the string.

	* src/lyxscreen.h (fillArc): new function.

	* src/FontInfo.C (resize): rewritten to use more std::string like
	structore, especially string::replace.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Draw): use fillArc for the
	approp. accents.

	* configure.in (chmod +x some scripts): remove config/gcc-hack 

1999-12-15  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/buffer.C (writeFile): change once again the top comment in a
	.lyx file to point to www.lyx.org and to use LYX_DOCVERSION
	instead of an hardcoded version number.
	(makeDocBookFile): ditto

	* src/version.h: add new define LYX_DOCVERSION

	* po/de.po: update from Pit Sütterlin
	* lib/bind/de_menus.bind: ditto.
	
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): call MenuExport()
	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): ditto

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuMakeHTML): new function, moved from
	LyXFunc::Dispatch().
	(MenuExport): new function, moved from
	LyXFunc::Dispatch().

	* src/trans_mgr.C (insert): small cleanup
	* src/chset.C (loadFile): ditto

	* lib/kbd/iso8859-1.cdef: add missing backslashes

1999-12-15  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (Lbearing): new function, used to
	help with placing the manually drawn accents better.
	(Rbearing): ditto
	(Draw): x2 and hg changed to float to minimize rounding errors and
	help place the accents better.

	* src/lyxfont.C (ascent): fixed faulty static_cast, casting from
	unsigned short to char is just wrong...cast the char to unsigned
	char instead so that the two values can compare sanely. This
	should also make the display of insetlatexaccents better and
	perhaps also some other insets.
	(descent): ditto
	(lbearing): new function
	(rbearing): ditto

1999-12-15  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/stl_string_fwd.h, src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES):  added new
	header that provides a wrapper around the very annoying SGI STL header
 	of the same name.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C, src/LString.h:
	removed old SGI-STL-compatability attempts.

	* configure.in: Use LYX_STL_STRING_FWD.

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_STL_STRING_FWD), acconfig.h: Test if 
	stl_string_fwd.h is around and try to determine it's location.
  	Major improvement over previous SGI STL 3.2 compatability.
	Three small problems remain with this function due to my zero
	knowledge of autoconf.  JMarc and lgb see the comments in the code.

1999-12-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/broken_const.h, config/hack-gcc, config/README: removed
	
	* configure.in: remove --with-gcc-hack option; do not call
	LYX_CXX_STL_STACK 

	* INSTALL: remove documentation of --with-broken-const and
	--with-gcc-hack
	
	* acconfig.h: remove all trace of BROKEN_CONST define

	* src/buffer.C (makeDocBookFile): update version number in output
	file. 
	(SimpleDocBookOnePar): fix an assert when trying to a character
	access beyond string length
	[Patch from Jose']

1999-12-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* po/de.po: fix the Export menu

	* lyx.man: update the description of -dbg

	* src/lyx_main.C (setDebuggingLevel): call Debug::showLevel()
	(commandLineHelp): updated
	(easyParse): show list of available debug levels if -dbg is passed
	without argument.

	* src/Makefile.am: add debug.C

	* src/debug.h: moved some code to debug.C

	* src/debug.C: new file. Contains code to set and show debug
	level. 

	* src/layout.C: remove 'break' after 'continue' in switch
	statements, since these cannot be reached.

1999-12-13  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/math_hash.C (math_hash): renamed from hash(), name clash.
 	(in_word_set): hash() -> math_hash()

	* src/LString.h: Used USING_EXCEPTIONS in SGI STL-3.2 support 

	* acconfig.h: Added a test for whether we are using exceptions in the
	current compilation run. If so USING_EXCEPTIONS is defined.

	* config.in: Check for existance of stl_string_fwd.h
	* src/LString.h: If compiling --with-included-string and SGI's
	STL version 3.2 is present (see above test) we need to block their
	forward declaration of string and supply a __get_c_string().
	However, it turns out this is only necessary if compiling with
	exceptions enabled so I've a bit more to add yet.

	* src/insets/figinset.[Ch], src/insets/insetinclude.C,
	  src/insets/insetloa.C, src/layout.h, src/lyxparagraph.h,
          src/support/LRegex.h, src/undo.h:
	Shuffle the order of the included files a little to ensure that
	LString.h gets included before anything that includes stl_string_fwd.h

	*  src/support/lyxstring.C: We need to #include LString.h instead of
	lyxstring.h to get the necessary definition of __get_c_string.
	(__get_c_string): New function.  This is defined static just like SGI's
	although why they need to do this I'm not sure.  Perhaps it should be
	in lstrings.C instead.

	* lib/templates/IEEEtran.lyx:  New template file.

1999-12-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>
	
	* Makefile.in.in (MKINSTALLDIRS): use $(srcdir)/@MKINSTALLDIRS@
	* intl/Makefile.in (MKINSTALLDIRS):  ditto

	* src/LyXAction.C (init): changed to hold the LFUN data in a
	automatic array in stead of in callso to newFunc, this speeds up
	compilation a lot. Also all the memory used by the array is
	returned when the init is completed.

	* a lot of files: compiled with -Wold-style-cast, changed most of
	the reported offenders to C++ style casts. Did not change the
	offenders in C files. 

	* src/trans.h (Match): change argument type to unsigned int.

	* src/support/DebugStream.C: fix some types on the streambufs so
	that it works on a conforming implementation.

1999-12-10  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/examples/example_{raw,lyxified}.lyx: fix embarassing sentence.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: remove the inline added earlier since
	they cause a bunch of unsatisfied symbols when linking with dec
	cxx. Cxx likes to have the body of inlines at the place where they
	are declared.

	* src/trans.C (AddDeadkey): add an 'unsigned char' cast to avoid
	accessing negative bounds in array. This fixes the crash when
	inserting accented characters.
	* src/trans.h (Match): ditto

	* src/buffer.C (Dispatch): since this is a void, it should not try
	to return anything...

1999-12-10  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/buffer.h: removed the two friends from Buffer. Some changes
	because of this. Buffer::getFileName and Buffer::setFileName
	renamed to Buffer::fileName() and Buffer::fileName(...).

1999-12-09  Lars Gullik Bjønnes <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* buffer.[Ch], BufferView.[Ch] + other files: Moved Buffer::text
	and Buffer::update(short) to BufferView. This move is currently
	controlled by a define MOVE_TEXT, this will be removed when all
	shows to be ok. This move paves the way for better separation
	between buffer contents and buffer view. One side effect is that
	the BufferView needs a rebreak when swiching buffers, if we want
	to avoid this we can add a cache that holds pointers to LyXText's
	that is not currently in use. 

	* buffer.[Ch], lyx_main.C: small changes to the "-export" patch by
	André Pönitz. 

1999-11-18  André Pönitz <poenitz@mathematik.tu-chemnitz.de>

	* buffer.[Ch]: Dispatch() - new dispatcher on the buffer level

	* lyx_main.C: new command line option -x (or --execute) and
	  -e (or --export). Now direct conversion from .lyx to .tex
	  (.dvi, .ps, ...) is possible  ('lyx file.lyx --export latex')
	  Unfortunately, X is still needed and the GUI pops up during the
	  process...

1999-12-07  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/Spacing.C: add a using directive to bring stream stuff into
	normal namespace.
	* src/paragraph.C: ditto
	* src/buffer.C: ditto

	* NEWS: updated a bit the new features of 1.1.3 (took a few things
	from Lars' announcement).

	* lib/examples/nl_voorbeeld_{ruw,verlyxt}.lyx: new tutorial
	example files from Tino Meinen.
	
1999-12-06  Allan Rae  <rae@lyx.org>

	* src/LaTeX.C (runBibTeX): fix typo in accessing submatch pair.

1999-12-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: added a lot of inline for no good
	reason
	
	* src/lyxfont.[Ch]: removed latexWriteStartChanges, and
	latexWriteEndChanges, they were not used.
	
	* src/layout.h (operator<<): output operator for PageSides

	* src/mathed/math_iter.C (my_memcpy): slightly changed.

	* some example files: loaded in LyX 1.0.4 and saved again to update
	certain constructs (table format) 

	* a lot of files: did the change to use fstream/iostream for all
	writing of files. Done with a close look at Andre Poenitz's patch.

	* some files: whitespace changes.
	
1999-12-06  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_iter.C (my_memcpy): new function. Since the
	built-in memcpy() is broken on egcs and gcc 2.95 for alpha
	architecture, we provide our own. It is used unconditionnally, but
	I do not think this is a performance problem. Thanks to Angus
	Leeming <a.leeming@ic.ac.uk> for the code (and again to Michal
	Jaegermann <michal@ellpspace.math.ualberta.ca> for finding it the
	first time).
	(GetInset): use my_memcpy.
	(Insert): ditto
	(Copy): ditto

	* lib/chkconfig.ltx: some cleanup of the latex code. I am not sure
	it is easier to understand, but it uses less TeX-only constructs now.

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_SEARCH_PROG): make it work when the PATH
	elements contain spaces

	* lib/configure: regenerated
	
	* lib/configure.m4 (SEARCH_PROG): make it work when the PATH
	elements contain spaces; display the list of programs that are
	tried.

	* autogen.sh: make sure lib/configure is executable

	* lib/examples/*: rename the tutorial examples to begin with the
	two-letters language code.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (getStatus): do not query current font if no
	buffer exists.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (RunScript): use QuoteName
	(MenuRunDvips): ditto
	(PrintApplyCB): ditto

	* src/support/filetools.[Ch] (QuoteName): new function. Add quotes
	around argument, so that it works well with the current shell.
	Does not work properly with OS/2 shells currently.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog): use Buffer::getLatexName
	* src/LyXSendto.C (SendtoApplyCB): ditto
	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): ditto
	* src/buffer.C (runLaTeX): ditto
	(runLiterate): ditto
	(buildProgram): ditto
	(runChktex): ditto
	* src/lyx_cb.C (RunScript): ditto
	(MenuMakeLaTeX): ditto
	
	* src/buffer.h (getLatexName): new method 

	* src/support/filetools.C (MakeLatexName): renamed from SpaceLess

1999-12-02  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* images/sqrt.xpm: change name of the sqrt icon to sqrt_xpm.
	* src/mathed/math_panel.C (mathed_get_pixmap_from_icon): ditto
	(create_math_panel): ditto

	* src/lyxfunc.C (getStatus): re-activate the code which gets
	current font and cursor; add test for export to html.

	* src/lyxrc.C (read): remove unreachable break statements; add a
	few "using".

	* src/bmtable.C (fl_set_bmtable_data): add a const_cast.
	
1999-12-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/mathed/formula.C (LocalDispatch): fix small whitspace bug
	introduced by faulty regex.
	* src/buffer.C: ditto
	* src/lastfiles.C: ditto
	* src/paragraph.C: ditto
	* src/table.C: ditto
	* src/vspace.C: ditto
	* src/insets/figinset.C: ditto
	Note: most of these is absolutely harmless, except the one in
	src/mathed formula.C.

1999-11-30  Kayvan A. Sylvan  <kayvan@satyr.sylvan.com>

	* src/ImportNoweb.C (documentclass): fixed bounds for substr
	  operation, yielding correct results for the reLyX command.

1999-12-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.C (ExpandPath): removed an over eager
	Assert.
	(ReplaceEnvironmentPath): ditto

	* src/toolbar.C (BubbleTimerCB): use C++ style casts. This clearly
	shows that we are doing something fishy in our code...
	(BubblePost): ditto
	(ToolbarCB): ditto

	* src/lyxrc.C (read): use a double switch trick to get more help
	from the compiler. (the same trick is used in layout.C)
	(write): new function. opens a ofstream and pass that to output
	(output): new function, takes a ostream and writes the lyxrc
	elemts to it. uses a dummy switch to make sure no elements are
	forgotten. 

	* src/lyxlex.h: added a struct pushpophelper for use in functions
	with more than one exit point.

	* src/lyxlex.[Ch] (GetInteger): made it const
	(GetFloat): ditto
	(GetBool): ditto

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): added case for LFUN_SAVEPREFERENCES

	* src/layout.[hC] : LayoutTags splitted into several enums, new
	methods created, better error handling cleaner use of lyxlex. Read
	the diff.

	* src/bmtable.[Ch]: change some member prototypes because of the
	image const changes. 

	* commandtags.h, src/LyXAction.C (init): new function:
	"preferences-save", saves the lyxrc entries into .lyx/preferences.
	This file is not read automatically but you can add \input
	preferences to your lyxrc if you want to. We need to discuss how

	(GhostscriptMsg): use static_cast
	(GhostscriptMsg): use new instead of malloc to allocate memory for
	cmap. also delete the memory after use.

	* src/mathed/symbol_def.h: swap the definitions of \varepsilon and
	\epsilon. Now \epsilon shows as red text, and \varepsilon shows as
	it should. This is of course a controversial change (since many
	people will find that their lyx workscreen is suddenly full of
	red), but done for the sake of correctness.

	* src/mathed/formulamacro.h, src/mathed/math_macro.[Ch],

	findtexfile from LaTeX to filetools.
	
	* src/ImportNoweb.C (documentclass): rewrote to use ifstream

	from Thomas Hartkens <thomas@hartkens.de>.

	unbreakable if we are in freespacing mode (LyX-Code), but not in
	latex mode.

1999-10-25  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/BackStack.h: fixed initialization order in constructor

1999-10-23  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (addNewlineAndDepth): changed to use string::append.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (append): fixed something that must be a
	bug, rep->assign was used instead of rep->append.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added LIstream.h
	and LOstream.h

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent): removed faulty line that made
	lyx insert double chars. Fix spotted by Kayvan.

1999-10-23  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@alstrup.galaxy.dk>

	* Fixed the tth support. I messed up with the Emacs patch apply feature
	and omitted the changes in lyxrc.C.

1999-10-22  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C (CallbackFig): Just changed the defines a bit.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuInsertRef) + 
	* src/lyx_gui.C (create_forms): Inserted fl_set_form_minsize so that
	the form cannot be resized under it limits (fixes a segfault)
	
	* src/lyx.C (create_form_form_ref) +
	* forms/lyx.fd: Changed Gravity on name input field so that it is
 	resized correctly.

1999-10-22  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_STL_MODERN_STREAMS; check for headers
	<ostream> and <istream>.
	
	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_MODERN_STREAMS): new test. Checks
	whether <fstream> provides the latest standard features, or if we
	have an oldstyle library (like in egcs).
	(LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): fix the test.

	* src/support/DebugStream.{C,h}: use L{I,O}stream.h and condition the
	code on MODERN_STL_STREAM.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: use L{I,O}stream.h.

	* src/support/L{I,O}stream.h: new files, designed to setup
	correctly streams for our use
	  - includes the right header depending on STL capabilities
	  - puts std::ostream and std::endl (for LOStream.h) or
	  std::istream (LIStream.h) in toplevel namespace.

1999-10-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/LaTeX.C (run): added a check in 0 sumchange so that if it
	was a bib file that had been changed we ensure that bibtex is run.
	(runBibTeX): enhanced to extract the names of the bib files and
	getting their absolute path and enter them into the dep file.
	(findtexfile): static func that is used to look for tex-files,
	checks for absolute patchs and tries also with kpsewhich.
	Alternative ways of finding the correct files are wanted. Will
	probably be moved.
	(do_popen): function that runs a command using popen and returns
	the whole output of that command in a string. Should be moved to
	somewhere else.

	* src/DepTable.[Ch] (extchanged): new function that returns true if a
	file with extension ext has changed.

	* src/insets/figinset.C: added ifdef guards around the fl_free
	code that jug commented out. Now it is commented out when
	compiling with XForms == 0.89.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: moved the definition of lyxstring::Srep
	to lyxstring.C, and only keep a forward declaration in
	lyxstring.h. Simplifies the header file a bit and should help a
	bit on compile time too. Also changes to Srep will not mandate a
	recompile of code just using string.
	(~lyxstring): definition moved here since it uses srep.
	(size): definition moved here since it uses srep.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: removed a couple of "inline" that should
	not be there.

1999-10-21  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	the 'ob' argument.

1999-10-21  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/table.C (SetPWidth): Just a small fix so the alignment is not
	set to left if I just remove the width entry (or it is empty).

	* src/text2.C (SetCursorIntern): Fixed a bug calculating to use wrong
	paragraph when having dummy paragraphs.

1999-10-20  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/insets/figinset.C: just commented some fl_free_form calls
	and added warnings so that this calls should be activated later
	again. This avoids for now a segfault, but we have a memory leak!

	* src/lyxfunc.C (processKeyEvent) (Dispatch): changed
 	'const char * argument' to 'string argument', this should
	fix some Asserts() in lyxstring.C.

	* src/lyxfunc.h: Removed the function argAsString(const char *)
	as it is not used anymore.

1999-10-20  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (getline): reads now _all_ chars. uses
	get instead of >>

	* src/Literate.h: some funcs moved from public to private to make
	interface clearer. Unneeded args removed.

	* src/Literate.C (scanLiterateLogFile): rewritten to use iostream
	instead of lyxlex.
	(scanBuildLogFile): ditto

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanLogFile): merged LaTeX Error handling into
	normal TeX Error. Still room for improvement.

	* src/LaTeX.[Ch]: removed scanError. Wrong place and not needed.

	* src/buffer.C (insertErrors): changes to make the error
	desctription show properly.

	* src/LaTeX.C (deplog): removed the test for file in lyx doc dir.
	could never happen

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): changed to use
	sizeof(object->rep->ref).
	(operator>>): changed to use a pointer instead.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: changed const reference & to value_type
	const & lets see if that helps.

1999-10-19  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Makefile.am (rpmdist): fixed to have non static package and
	verison.

	* src/support/lyxstring.C: removed the compilation guards

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): use i + 1  instead of ++i. Maks things
	a bit clearer.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (LYXSTRING): bruker USE_LYXSTRING for
	conditional compile of lyxstring.Ch

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): new and improved, still a
	stupid check, but it is a lot better than the bastring hack. 
	(LYX_CXX_STL_STRING): bruker nå AM_CONDITIONAL(USE_LYXSTRING  

	* several files: changed string::erase into string::clear. Not
	really needed.
	
	* src/chset.C (encodeString): use a char temporary instead

	* src/table.C (TexEndOfCell): added tostr around
	column_of_cell(fcell+i)+1 and around right_column_of_cell(fcell+i)+1
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(TexEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto
	(DocBookEndOfCell): ditto

	* src/paragraph.C (TeXEnvironment): added tostr around foot_count -1

	* src/lyxfr1.C (SearchReplaceAllCB): added tostr around replace_count

	* src/lyx_cb.C (MenuRunLaTeX): added tostr around ret
	(MenuBuildProg): added tostr around ret
	(MenuRunChktex): added tostr around ret
	(DocumentApplyCB): added tostr around ret

	* src/chset.C (encodeString): added tostr around t->ic

	* src/buffer.C (makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around secnumdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around tocdepth
	(makeLaTeXFile): added tostr around ftcound - 1

	* src/insets/insetbib.C (setCounter): added tostr around counter.

	* src/support/lyxstring.h: added an operator+=(int) to catch more
	mistakes. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.
	(lyxstring): We DON'T allow NULL pointers.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/mathed/math_macro.C (MathMacroArgument::Write,
	MathMacroTemplate::WriteDef): add tostr() around macro arg numbers
	when writing them out.

	* src/LString.C: remove, since it is not used anymore.
	
	* src/support/lyxstring.C: condition the content to
	USE_INCLUDED_STRING macro.

	* src/mathed/math_symbols.C, src/support/lstrings.C,
	src/support/lyxstring.C: add `using' directive to specify what
	we need in <algorithm>. I do not think that we need to
	conditionalize this, but any thought is appreciated.

	* many files: change all callback functions to "C" linkage
	functions to please strict C++ compilers like DEC cxx 6.1 in mode
	strict_ansi. Those who were static are now global. 
  	    The case of callbacks which are static class members is
	trickier, since we have to make C wrappers around them (see
	InsetError, InsetInfo and InsetUrl). The same holds for friends. I
	did not finish this yet, since it defeats the purpose of
	encapsulation, and I am not sure what the best route is.

1999-10-19  Juergen Vigna  <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (lyxstring): we permit to have a null
	pointer as assignment value and just don't assign it.

	* src/vspace.C (nextToken): corrected this function substituting
	find_first(_not)_of with find_last_of.

	* src/TableLayout.C (UpdateLayoutTable) (TableOptionsCB)
 		(TableOptCloseCB) (TableSpeCloseCB):
	inserted fl_set_focus call for problem with fl_hide_form() in
 	xforms-0.89.

1999-10-19  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyx_cb.C (LayoutsCB): fix bug where int was added to a
	string. 

1999-10-18  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/lyxrc.C (Read): RC_PRINTEXSTRAOPTIONS now uses
	LyXLex::next() and not eatline() to get its argument.

1999-10-17  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/DepTable.[Ch]: rewritten to store the dependencies in a map
	instead, use fstreams for io of the depfile, removed unneeded
	functions and variables.

	vector instead, removed all functions and variables that is not in
	use.

	* development/.cvsignore: new file.

1999-10-14  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* acinclude.m4 (LYX_CXX_CHEADERS): New macro. Checks whether the
	C++ compiler provides wrappers for C headers and use our alternate
	version otherwise.

	* configure.in: use LYX_CXX_CHEADERS.

	* src/cheader/: new directory, populated with cname headers from
	libstdc++-2.8.1. They are a bit old, but probably good enough for
	what we want (support compilers who lack them).
	
	* src/insets/Makefile.am, src/mathed/Makefile.am: remove src/support
	from includes. It turns out is was stupid.
 
1999-10-14  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (install-data-local): forgot a ';'
	(install-data-local): forgot a '\'

	* po/*.po: merged with lyx.pot becuase of make distcheck
	
	* lib/Makefile.am (dist-hook): added dist-hook so that
	documentation files will be included when doing a make
	dist/distdir/distcheck. Requires cvs export -r HEAD lyxdoc to run.

	conditional later.
	more: tried to make install do the right thing, exclude CVS dirs
	etc.

	* src/LaTeXLog.C (ShowLatexLog): reordered som statements so that
	Path would fit in more nicely.

	* all files that used to use pathstack: uses now Path instead.
	This change was a lot easier than expected.

	* src/support/Makefile.am (libsupport_a_SOURCES): added path.h

	* src/Makefile.am (lyx_SOURCES): removed pathstack.[Ch]

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (getline): Default arg was given for
	para 3. removed.

	* Configure.cmd: removed file 

1999-10-13  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/support/DebugStream.[Ch]: remove the explicit std:: before
	streams classes and types, add the proper 'using' statements when
	MODERN_STL is defined.

	  not fully implemented yet.

	* src/*.C: Changed Systemcalls::Startscript() to startscript()

	* src/support/FileInfo.h: Better documentation	

	* src/lyxfunc.C: Added support for buffer-export html
	
	* src/menus.C: Added Export->As HTML...
	
	* lib/bind/*.bind: Added short-cut for buffer-export html

	* src/lyxrc.*: Added support for new \tth_command
	
	* lib/lyxrc.example: Added stuff for new \tth_command

1999-10-12  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* lib/Makefile.am (IMAGES): removed images/README
	(pkgdata_SCRIPTS): use this instead of bin_SCRIPTS to that it
	installes in correct place. Check permisions is installed
	correctly.

	* src/LaTeX.C: some no-op changes moved declaration of some
	variables around.

	* src/LaTeX.h (LATEX_H): changed include guard name

1999-10-12  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* lib/reLyX/Makefile.am: install noweb2lyx.

	* lib/Makefile.am: install configure. 

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: declare a config aux dir; set package
	name to lyx (not sure what the best solution is); generate noweb2lyx.

	* lib/layouts/egs.layout: fix the bibliography layout.

1999-10-08  Jürgen Vigna <jug@sad.it>

	* src/support/filetools.C (FileOpenSearch): Fixed a bug where
	when in the PATH was something like /usr/bin;;/bin (note: the ;;)
	it returned without continuing to search the path.
	
1999-10-07  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Draw): Simplified a gread deal. This
	also fixes a bug. It is not allowed to do tricks with std::strings
	like: string a("hei"); &a[e]; this will not give what you
	think... Any reason for the complexity in this func?

1999-10-06  Asger Alstrup Nielsen  <alstrup@diku.dk>

	* Updated README and INSTALL a bit, mostly to check that my
	CVS rights are correctly set up.

1999-10-06  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/lyxstring.C (helper): removed bogus Assert. strlen
	does not allow '\0' chars but lyxstring and std::string does.

1999-10-05  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* autogen.sh (AUTOCONF): let the autogen script create the
	POTFILES.in file too. POTFILES.in should perhaps now not be
	included in the cvs module.

	* some more files changed to use C++ includes instead of C ones.

	* src/filedlg.C (Reread): fixed a bug wrt Time. It was appended
	not assigned.
	(Reread): added tostr to nlink. buggy output otherwise.
	(Reread): added a string() around szMode when assigning to Buffer,
	without this I got a log of garbled info strings.

	* acconfig.h: commented out the PTR_AS_INT macros. They should not
	be needed.

	* I have added several ostream & operator<<(ostream &, some_type)
	functions. This has been done to avoid casting and warnings when
	outputting enums to lyxerr. This as thus eliminated a lot of
	explicit casts and has made the code clearer. Among the enums
	affected: kb_action, InsetLatexAccent::ACCENT_TYPE, a couple of
	mathed enums, some font enum the Debug::type enum. 

	* src/support/lyxstring.h (clear): missing method. equivalent of
	erase(0, npos).

	* all files that contained "stderr": rewrote constructs that used
	stderr to use lyxerr instead. (except bmtable)

	* src/support/DebugStream.h (level): and the passed t with
	Debug::ANY to avoid spurious bits set.

	* src/debug.h (Debug::type value): made it accept strings of the
	type INFO,INIT,KEY.

	* configure.in (Check for programs): Added a check for kpsewhich,
	the latex generation will use this later to better the dicovery of
	all used files. 

	* src/BufferView.C (create_view): we don't need to cast this to
	(void*) that is done automatically.
	(WorkAreaButtonPress): removed some dead code.

1999-10-05  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/minibuffer.C (Init): make sure that the "Welcome to LyX!"
	is not overwritten when translated (David Sua'rez de Lis).

	* lib/CREDITS: Added David Sua'rez de Lis

	* lib/reLyX/configure.in: setup LYX_DIR correctly in reLyX.

	* src/bufferparams.C (BufferParams): default input encoding is now
	"latin1" 

	* acinclude.m4 (cross_compiling): comment out macro
	LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE. 

	* acconfig.h: make sure that const is not defined (to empty) when
	we are compiling C++. Remove commented out code using SIZEOF_xx
	macros.
	
	* configure.in : move the test for const and inline as late as
	possible so that these C tests do not interefere with C++ ones.
	Remove the call to LYX_GXX_STRENGTH_REDUCE, since its usefulness
	has not been proven. 

1999-10-04  Jean-Marc Lasgouttes  <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>

	* src/table.C (getDocBookAlign): remove bad default value for
	isColumn parameter.

	* src/menus.C (ShowFileMenu): add a missing tostr() for lastfiles
	shortcut. 
	(ShowFileMenu2): ditto.

	* lib/reLyX/.cvsignore: add configure and aclocal.m4 to the list
	of files to ignore.

1999-10-04  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* Most files: finished the change from the old error code to use
	DebugStream for all lyxerr debugging. Only minor changes remain
	(e.g. the setting of debug levels using strings instead of number) 

1999-10-02  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/layout.C (Add): Changed to use compare_no_case instead of
	strcasecmp.

	* src/FontInfo.C: changed loop variable type too string::size_type.

1999-10-01  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/Makefile.am: added -I${srcdir}/../ to INCLUDES and
	set ETAGS_ARGS to --c++ 

1999-09-30  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/table.C (DocBookEndOfCell): commented out two unused variables

	* src/paragraph.C: commented out four unused variables. 

	* src/lyx_cb.C (TocUpdateCB): moved variable i and added a new i
	insed a if clause with type string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfr1.C (IsSearchStringInText): changed iSrch from int to
	string::size_type.

	* src/lyxfunc.C (Dispatch): use string::size_type as loop variable.

	* src/lyx_cb.C (ReplaceWord): use string::size_type as loop
	variable, also changed loop to go from 0 to lenght + 1, instead of
	-1 to length. This should be correct.

	* src/LaTeX.C (scanError): use string::size_type as loop variable
	type.

	* src/BufferView.C (WorkAreaButtonPress): moved #if 0 up two lines
	(l.896) since y_tmp and row was not used anyway.

	* src/insets/insetref.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetquotes.C (Width): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.
	(Draw): use string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlatexaccent.C (checkContents): use
	string::size_type as loop variable type.

	* src/insets/insetlabel.C (escape): use string::size_type as loop
	variable type.

	* src/insets/insetinfo.C: added an extern for current_view.

	* src/insets/insetcommand.C (scanCommand): use string::size_type
	as loop variable type.

	* most files: removed the RCS tags. With them we had to recompile
	a lot of files after a simple cvs commit. Also we have never used
	them for anything meaningful. 

	* most files: tags-query-replace NULL 0. As adviced several plases
	we now use "0" instead of "NULL" in our code. 

	* src/support/filetools.C (SpaceLess): use string::size_type as
	loop variable type.

1999-09-29  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/paragraph.C: fixed up some more string stuff.

1999-09-28  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* src/support/filetools.h: make modestr a std::string.

	* src/filetools.C (GetEnv): made ch really const.

	* src/lyxlib.h: removed the Maximum and Minimum inline functions,
	made code that used these use max/min from <algorithm> instead.

	* changed several c library include files to their equivalent c++
	library include files. All is not changed yet.

	* created a support subdir in src, put lyxstring and lstrings
	there + the extra files atexit, fileblock, strerror. Created
	Makefile.am. edited configure.in and src/Makefile.am to use this
	new subdir. More files moved to support.

	* imported som of the functions from repository lyx, filetools
	
	* ran tags-query-replace on LString -> string, corrected the bogus
	cases. Tried to make use of lstrings.[hC], debugged a lot. There
	is still some errors in there. This is errors where too much or
	too litle get deleted from strings (string::erase, string::substr,
	string::replace), there can also be some off by one errors, or
	just plain wrong use of functions from lstrings. Viewing of quotes
	is wrong. 

	* LyX is now running fairly well with string, but there are
	certainly some bugs yet (see above) also string is quite different
	from LString among others in that it does not allow null pointers
	passed in and will abort if it gets any.
	
        * Added the revtex4 files I forgot when setting up the repository.

1999-09-27  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* All over: Tried to clean everything up so that only the files
	  that we really need are included in the cvs repository.
	* Switched to use automake.
	* Generaton of reLyX is not perfect, LYX_DIR does not get substituted.
	* Install has not been checked.

1999-09-22  Lars Gullik Bjønnes  <larsbj@lyx.org>

	* po/pt.po: Three errors:
	       l.533 and l.538 format specification error
	       l. 402 duplicate entry, I just deleted it.
