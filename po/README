How can I update an existing po file?
-------------------------------------

It requires a bit of work to get started, but once you are set up,
the procedure should be relatively easy:

1) Getting ready

Get and install gettext (available from ftp://alpha.gnu.org). Read the
documentation for gettext. Then get the latest LyX distribution including 
patches, and unpack it in your home directory. It is yet better if you checkout
the CVS version of LyX.
Read the README in the LyX distribution.
Check the mailing list archives to learn what is going on at the moment. 
Consider subscribing to the developer's mailing list, lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org.

2) Preparing a patch

Now do (where XX stands for the code of your language):

        cp -R lyx-*.*.* lyx.new
			(Which makes a copy of the source distribution for 
			 you to change, but you should work in a CVS workarea)
 	 	cd lyx.new/po/

		make XX.pox
			(It merges the po file into the temporary file XX.pox)
        emacs XX.pox                           
			(Using po-mode. Emacs is convenient for po editing, but not
			 mandatory.)
	    (Make all necessary changes in XX.pox, and save.)
        mv XX.pox XX.po
        rm XX.pox~
			(To remove Emacs autosave.)
		make XX.gmo
		(Update the ChangeLog file.)

		cd ..

		(Maybe update lib/CREDITS)

		cvs diff -u > XX_po_update.patch
			(Or whatever good method to have a patch in unified diff format)

3) Submitting the patch

	Check your patch and mail it to lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org

Thanks!

The LyX Team.
