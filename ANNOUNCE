Public release of LyX version 2.0.8.1
=====================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 2.0.8.1. This release
differs from the 2.0.8 release only by incorporating some improvements
to the lyx2lyx conversion and reversion scripts. There are no changes
to the main code.

LyX 2.0.8 was the eighth and final maintenance release in the 2.0.x 
series, the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version even 
more reliable and stable. We fixed a number of bugs and made a number 
of improvements since 2.0.7.

The main "feature" of LyX 2.0.8 is the ability to read and write LyX
files in the 2.1.x format. Users who do not wish to upgrade to 2.1.0,
which is being released simultaneously, are encouraged to upgrade to
2.0.8.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.0.8 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org), or open a bug

documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
