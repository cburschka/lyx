Public release of LyX version 2.3.2
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.3.2. This is the second
maintenance release in the 2.3.x series. 

You can download LyX 2.3.2 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.3.2 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more 
reliable and more stable. One main fix involves a crash with external viewers 
on Windows. We have also fixed a number of problems with the output of right-
to-left languages, thanks to the involvement of users. There was also an 
infinite loop bug connected with the separation of environments that has been 
fixed. But, for the most part, the fixes here are incremental. Please see below 
for a full list.
  
If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.2, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the documentation 
that comes with LyX (under the Help or Apple menu) and the LyX wiki, which 
is at http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the 
LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org), where you will find an 
active community of people who are ready to help.

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.3.2.

The LyX team.
