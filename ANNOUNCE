Public release of LyX version 2.3.6
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.3.6. This is the sixth
maintenance release in the 2.3.x series. We encourage all users to
upgrade to this version.

You can download LyX 2.3.6 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.3.6 is the sixth maintenance release in the 2.3.x series. It is the 
result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more reliable and 
more stable. Most of the changes are fairly minor, fixes of smallish bugs, 
but a couple crashes have been fixed, as well. 

One oft-requested feature (going back 13 years) is the ability to create
new child documents from within the 'include file' dialog. This is now
possible. Another equally old bug that has been fixed is that pasting
table content outside a table no longer pastes tab characters.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.6, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the documentation 
that comes with LyX (under the Help or Apple menu) and the LyX wiki, which 
is at http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the 
LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org), where you will find an 
active community of people who are ready to help.

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.3.6.

The LyX team.
