Public release of LyX version 2.3.1
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.3.1. This is the first
maintenance release in the 2.3.x series. 

You can download LyX 2.3.1 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.3.1 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more 
reliable and more stable. <CONTINUE>

One oft-requested enhancement was to restore a keyboard shortcut for opening
the 'settings' menu of graphics, reference, etc, insets. This is now Control-
Alt-i, on Windows and Linux, and Control-Option-i on OSX (assuming you are
using the default keybindings).

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.1, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the documentation 
that comes with LyX (under the Help or Apple menu) and the LyX wiki, which 
is at http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the 
LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org), where you will find an 
active community of people who are ready to help.

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.3.1.

The LyX team.
