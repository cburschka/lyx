Public release of LyX version 2.3.5
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.3.5. This is the fifth
maintenance release in the 2.3.x series. We encourage all users to
upgrade to this version.

You can download LyX 2.3.5 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.3.5 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more 
reliable and more stable. Most of the changes are incremental, but quite a 
few important bugs have now been fixed.

One important change is that Inkscape 1.0 is now supported: It will be detected
and configured automatically. Users of previous versions have recently reported
configuration failures when Inkscape 1.0 is installed, leading to an incomplete
(and all but unusable) installation of LyX. This should also be fixed.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.5, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the documentation 
that comes with LyX (under the Help or Apple menu) and the LyX wiki, which 
is at http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the 
LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org), where you will find an 
active community of people who are ready to help.

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.3.5.

The LyX team.
