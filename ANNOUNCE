Public release of LyX version 2.2.0rc1
========================================

We are proud to announce the first release candidate of LyX 2.2.0.

With this release, LyX celebrates 20 years of existence. The 2.2 series
has a rich set of new features compared to the current stable series.

LyX 2.2.0rc1 is the culmination of two years of hard work. An overview
of the new features can be found here:

You can download LyX 2.2.0rc1 from ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/.

We hope you will enjoy the result!

The file lib/RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues and problems compared
to the current stable releases (LyX 2.1.x). We strongly recommend that
packagers of LyX on various platforms and distributions read this file.

As with any major release, this one comes with a lot of new features but
also some bugs. If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.2.0rc1, either

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX (under Help) and the LyX wiki, which you
