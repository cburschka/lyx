Public release of LyX version 1.6.2
===================================

We are pleased to announce the release of LyX 1.6.2. This is the second
maintenance release in the 1.6.x series. The release fixes a large number
of major and critical bugs that were reported by users of LyX 1.6.0 and 
1.6.1. Most notably, two bugs that might lead to dataloss were detected
and resolved. Furthermore, a number of crashes, file conversion and LaTeX 
output problems are fixed. As a bonus, the performance of the application
has been improved, and the release also introduces some new features and
user interface improvements.

All users of LyX 1.6.0 and LyX 1.6.1 are urged to upgrade to this version.

A detailed list of changes is appended below, remaining known problems
are listed in the file RELEASE-NOTES.

In case you are wondering what LyX is, here is what
http://www.lyx.org/ has to say on the subject:

   LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing
   based on the structure of your documents, not their appearance. It
   is released under a Free Software/Open Source license.

   LyX is for people that write and want their writing to look great,
   right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
   details, 'finger painting' font attributes or futzing around with
   page boundaries. You just write. In the background, Prof. Knuth's
   legendary TeX typesetting engine makes you look good.

   On screen, LyX looks like any word processor; its printed output --
   or richly cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced -- looks
   like nothing else. Gone are the days of industrially bland .docs,
   all looking similarly not-quite-right, yet coming out unpredictably
   different on different printer drivers. Gone are the crashes
   'eating' your dissertation the evening before going to press.

   LyX is stable and fully featured. It is a multi-platform, fully
   internationalized application running natively on Unix/Linux, the
   Macintosh and modern Windows platforms.

You can download LyX 1.6.2 here (the .bz2 are compressed with bzip2,
which yields smaller files):

	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.2.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.2.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.2.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.devel.lyx.org/pub/lyx/lyx-1.6.2.tar.bz2

and it should propagate shortly to the following mirrors (which will
also host the .bz2 versions):

        ftp://ftp.lip6.fr/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.2.tar.gz
	http://lyx.cybermirror.org/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.2.tar.gz

        http://lyx.mirror.fr/stable/1.6.x/lyx-1.6.2.tar.gz

Prebuilt binaries (rpms for Linux distributions, Mac OS X and Windows
installers) should soon be available at
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/bin/1.6.2/

If you already have the sources of the previous release, you may want to apply
one of the following patches instead
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/patch-1.6.2.gz
	ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/stable/1.6.x/patch-1.6.2.bz2

If you find what you think is a bug in LyX 1.6.2, you may either
e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel <at> lists.lyx.org),
or open a bug report at http://bugzilla.lyx.org

If you're having trouble using the new version of LyX, or have a
question, first check out http://www.lyx.org/help/. If you can't find
the answer there, e-mail the LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).
