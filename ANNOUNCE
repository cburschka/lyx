Public release of LyX version 2.2.4
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.2.4. This is the fourth and
final maintenance release in the 2.2.x series. 

You can download LyX 2.2.4 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.2.4 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more 
reliable and more stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made several 
improvements. Most users, however, will want to upgrade to LyX 2.3.0, which 
was released shortly before 2.2.4. Users who want or need to continue using
the 2.2.x series, however, should in most cases upgrade to 2.2.4. Perhaps its
most important new feature is that it is able to read and write files in the
2.3.x format. Please note, however, that the conversion process back and forth 
usually will not leave one with an identical file, so we do not recommend that
users of 2.2.4 try to collaborate with users of 2.3.x.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.2.4, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. Please note, however, that bugs discovered in
2.2.4 will only be fixed in the 2.3.x series (if they still exist there), as
there will be no further releases in the 2.2.x series.

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.2.4.

The LyX team.
