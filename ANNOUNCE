Public release of LyX version 2.2.1
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.2.1.

LyX 2.2.1 is the first maintenance released in the 2.2.x series.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

You can download LyX 2.2.1 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX 2.2.1 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more 
reliable and more stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made a number 
of improvements. FILL IN

One important change is to the behavior of character styles. By default,
these now prohibit changes to the paragraph layout. Putting a description 
inside a character style typically results in invalid LaTeX code, so this 
makes certain mistakes harder to make. Power users who have taken advantage 
of the previous behavior can restore it by adding "ForcePlain 0" to the 
declaration of the character style, so long as this is done after "LyXType 
charstyle" has been declared.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.2.1, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.2.1.

The LyX team.
