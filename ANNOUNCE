Public release of LyX version 2.3.7
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.3.7. This is the seventh
maintenance release in the 2.3.x series. We encourage all users to
upgrade to this version.

You can download LyX 2.3.7 from https://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.3.7 is the  result of on-going efforts to make our stable version
more reliable and more stable. Since it has been quite a long time (for
unsurprising reasons) since the last update, this one contains more fixes
than usual. We have fixed a number of crashes.

One important note: Recent versions of Mac OSX do not include a working 
version of Python. LyX needs this for proper functionality. See 
"https://wiki.lyx.org/Mac/Mac#toc2 for information on how to install 
Python, if you need to do so. The most obvious sympton is that, on 
startup, LyX reports that it will have 'minimal functionality'. Another
symptom is that images or previews do not display properly.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.6, please open a bug report at
https://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the documentation 
that comes with LyX (under the Help or Apple menu) and the LyX wiki, which 
is at https://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the 
LyX users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org), where you will find an 
active community of people who are ready to help.

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.3.7.

The LyX team.
