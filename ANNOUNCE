Public release of LyX version 2.2.2
===================================

We are proud to announce the release of LyX 2.2.2. This is the second
maintenance release in the 2.2.x series. 

You can download LyX 2.2.2 from http://www.lyx.org/Download/.

LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to writing based 
on the structure of your documents and not simply their appearance. It is
released under a Free and Open Source Software license.

LyX 2.2.2 is the result of on-going efforts to make our stable version more 
reliable and more stable. We have fixed a number of bugs and made a number 
of improvements. Most of these are relatively minor, but we nonetheless
encourage all users of 2.2.1 to upgrade to this version.



One new feature is the use of the "scaling" option when exporting images
for XHTML. This does not work the same way as with LaTeX export. What it
does is add something like "width: 50%" to the style attribute. This will
ordinarily be interpreted by the browser as a percentage relative to the
current element.

If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.2.2, please open a bug report at
http://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome. If you're not sure whether it
really is a bug, you can e-mail the LyX developers' mailing list (lyx-devel 
<at> lists.lyx.org) and ask. 

If you have trouble using LyX or have a question, consult the
documentation that comes with LyX and the LyX wiki, which lives at
http://wiki.lyx.org/. If you can't find the answer there, e-mail the LyX 
users' list (lyx-users <at> lists.lyx.org).

We hope you enjoy using LyX 2.2.2.

The LyX team.
