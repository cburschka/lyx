Public release of LyX version 2.3.0alpha1-1
========================================

We are proud to announce 2.3.0alpha1-1 of the new LyX 2.3 series.
2.3.0alpha1-1 differs from 2.3.0alpha1 only by two minor changes that are
required to build the Windows installer.

With this release, LyX celebrates 21 years of existence. The 2.3 series
has a rich set of new features compared to the current stable series.

LyX 2.3.0alpha1-1 is the culmination of one year of hard work. An overview
of the new features can be found here:

You can download LyX 2.3.0alpha1-1 from ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/lyx/devel/.

We hope you will enjoy the result!

The file lib/RELEASE-NOTES lists some known issues and problems compared
to the current stable releases (LyX 2.2.x). We strongly recommend that
packagers of LyX on various platforms and distributions read this file.

As with any major release, this one comes with a lot of new features but
also some bugs. If you think you have found a bug in LyX 2.3.0alpha1-1, either
