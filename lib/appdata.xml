  <summary>The Document Processor</summary>
  <description>
    <p>LyX is a document processor that encourages an approach to
    writing based on the structure of your documents (WYSIWYM) and
    not simply their appearance (WYSIWYG).</p>
    <p>LyX combines the power and flexibility of TeX/LaTeX with the
    ease of use of a graphical interface. This results in
    world-class support for creation of mathematical content (via a
    fully integrated equation editor) and structured documents like
    academic articles, theses, and books. In addition, staples of
    scientific authoring such as reference list and index creation
    come standard. But you can also use LyX to create a letter or a
    novel or a theatre play or film script. A broad array of ready,
    well-designed document layouts are built in.</p>
    <p>LyX is for people who want their writing to look great,
    right out of the box. No more endless tinkering with formatting
    details, “finger painting” font attributes or futzing around
    with page boundaries. You just write. On screen, LyX looks like
    any word processor; its printed output — or richly
    cross-referenced PDF, just as readily produced — looks like
    nothing else.</p>
