README           - General info, pointer to man page
MANIFEST         - this file (hopefully)
CHANGES          - changes from various versions
BUGS             - bugs (note that some larger bugs are in the man page)
syntax.default   - file describing LaTeX syntax

TODO             - future plans

******* Files of interest to developers (maybe)
reLyXmain.pl     - Executable Perl script to translate LaTeX to LyX
reLyX.in         - input file to generate wrapper script 'reLyX', which gets
		   installed in user's path, e.g., /usr/local/bin
		   reLyX calls reLyXmain.pl
noweb2lyx.in     - input file to generate noweb2lyx, for converting noweb
		   file to LyX. noweb2lyx calls reLyX. Alternatively (but
		   not recursively) reLyX -n calls noweb2lyx

test.ltx         - test tex file
test.lyx         - LyX file created by running 'reLyX.pl test.ltx'

reLyX.pod        - documentation. Used to generate man page
		   (could be used to make HTML or text, too!)

*.pm are files containing subroutines (aka modules) which reLyX.pl calls
MakePreamble.pm  - split off and translate the LaTeX preamble
CleanTeX.pm      - "Clean" the TeX file
BasicLyX.pm      - main translation pass
LastLyX.pm       - final pass: create the LyX file
ReadCommands.pm  - subs to read and use a file containing LaTeX syntax
RelyxFigure.pm   - classes & methods for handling LaTeX figures
RelyxTable.pm    - classes & methods for handling LaTeX tables
Verbatim.pm      - subs to copy stuff exactly (e.g, \verb or unknown commands)

Text/TeX.pm      - Text::TeX package which contains the TeX parser
                   ./Text/TeX.pm was originally copied from 
		   Text-TeX-0.01/Text/TeX.pm, but has been changed.
Text/manpage.3pm   original manpage for Text::TeX

Text::TeX v0.01 was originally obtained from CPAN, but it has been
changed rather significantly.  The original package was written by Ilya
Zakharevich (ilya@math.ohio-state.edu)
