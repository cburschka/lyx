# This file is a database of LaTeX commands for unicode characters.
# These commands will be used by LyX for LaTeX export for all characters
# that are not representable in the chosen encoding.

# If you change this file please keep the order and indentation!
# You can use development/tools/unicodesymbols.py to add stubs for more
# symbols.
# Do only add commands that give correct output, no hacks that look "similar".
# Commands that modify other parts of the text should not be added either.
# For this reason, all commands requiring txfonts, pxfonts, fourier, mathdesign
# and MnSymbol are commented out (these packages switch to fonts like times or
# palatino). mathabx is not used because of many clashes with AMS math.

# syntax:
# ucs4 textcommand                textpreamble flags mathcommand mathpreamble
# textcommand and textpreamble are used if the symbol occurs in textmode.
# mathcommand and mathpreamble are used if the symbol occurs in mathmode.
# Both mathcommand and mathpreamble are optional.
# textpreamble and mathpreamble can either be a feature known by the LaTeXFeatures
# class (e.g. tipa), or a LaTeX command (e.g. \\usepackage{bla}).
# Features may be combined using '|', in this case one of the alternatives is
# chosen. The algorithm tries to satisfy as many requirements as possible.
# Therefore it may depend on the whole document contents which feature is chosen.
# Known flags:
# - combining          This is a combining char that will get combined with a base char
# - force              Always output replacement command
# - force=enc1;enc2... Always output replacement command in the specified encodings.
# - force!=en1;en2...  Always output replacement command in all but the specified encodings.
#                      Symbols are never forced in encodings with iconv name
#                      UTF-8 and package none (currently only utf8-plain).
# - mathalpha          This character is considered as a math variable in mathmode
# - notermination=text Do not terminate this textcommand (by {} or space).
#                      This is set by default if textcommand ends with }.
# - notermination=math Do not terminate this mathcommand (by {} or space).
#                      This is set by default if mathcommand ends with }.
# - notermination=both Do not terminate this textcommand and mathcommand (by {} or space).
# - notermination=none Always terminate this textcommand and mathcommand (by {} or space).
# - tipashortcut=<shortcut> Shortcut notation for TIPA
# - deprecated         Do not use this symbol for backwards conversion in LyX and tex2lyx.
