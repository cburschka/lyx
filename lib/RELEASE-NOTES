!Important Changes in LyX 2.3.0


!!Interface changes

* LyX now has "inverted" branch insets, which output their contents just in 
  case a given branch is not "activated". This makes inclusion of alternate
  material in different versions easier.

* When inserting a command or symbol in mathed, it is now automatically
  wrapped in a real inset (either \text or \ensuremath) assuring the correct
  mode, instead of being wrapped only in the output. The wrapping inset can
  be safely dissolved, as it will be automatically inserted at export time
  if needed, as usual.

* LyX now outputs en- and em-dashes as -- and --- ligatures when exporting to
  latex using TeX fonts, as done in version 2.1 and earlier. In version 2.2
  they were instead output as the macros \textendash and \textemdash, causing
  changed output with old documents and bugs. The 2.2 behavior can be restored
  by don't allowing using dash ligatures in Document->Settings->Fonts.


!!Documents compilation process and images conversion

* The converters definition syntax (LYX_HOME/lyxrc*) now supports a
  new option, 'needauth', to prevent completely automated execution of
  the converter, unless LyX acquired explicit consent by the
  user. This is a new security feature, useful for converters that are
  capable of executing arbitrary code, such as R scripts (used with
  sweave/knitr), embedded within LyX documents. The user needs to
  explicitly grant per-document permission on the first need for using
  the converter on each document, unless he/she checks the "Don't ask
  again for this document" checkbox in the permission dialog. The new
  behavior can be fine-tuned from two new options in the preferences
  dialog (see their description below). These also allow for disabling
  'needauth' converters altogether, if desired (default behavior).

* LyX now supports insertion and automated conversion of Gnuplot scripts,
  recognized by their typical extension ".gp" or ".gnuplot". These can
  directly be inserted in a LyX document using the "Insert->Graphics..."
  dialog, then selecting the Gnuplot script. LyX automatically adds a
  proper "set terminal ..." and "set output ..." line to convert the
  file to the needed output format (e.g., .eps, .pdf), depending on
  whether the document is being previewed on screen or compiled as PDF
  or other formats. Terminal options cannot be fine-tuned at the moment,
  but that's a capability that may come soon, also according to the
  received feedback from users.


!!!The following pref variables were added in 2.3:

* \use_converter_needauth
  when enabled, user is asked before calling any external converter with the
  'needauth' option

* \use_converter_needauth_forbidden
  when enabled, use of external converters with the 'needauth' option is
  forbidden


!!!The following pref variables were changed in 2.3:


!!!The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.3:


!!!The following new LyX functions have been introduced in 2.3:

* branch-invert
  Toggles inversion status of branch inset.

* lyx-activate
  Activates the LyX window. Useful in combination with reverse search.


!!!The following LyX functions have been changed in 2.3:

* quote-insert
  The function now has a second and third optional argument to specify
  the side (left, right, auto) and quotation mark style (english, swedish,
  german, polish, french, danish).

* inset-modify
  This function now also applies to quote insets. It takes a three-character
  string as an argument, refering (1.) to the style (e = ``english'',
  s = ''swedish'', g = ,,german``, p = ,,polish'', f = <<french>>, a = >>danish<<),
  (2.) to the side (l = left, r = right) and (3.) to the quotation level
  (s = single, d = double). So "eld" means "English left double quotation mark".
  A dot in the string means: take the current value. So "inset-modify changetype e.."
  will only change the style to English, while letting side and level as is,
  "inset-modify changetype f.s" will change the style to French and the level to
  single, leaving the side value.

  This function is most useful when combined with inset-forall. E.g.,
  "inset-forall Quotes inset-modify changetype f.."
   => change all quote insets to French style, maintaining current side and level
  "inset-forall Quotes inset-modify changetype ..s"
   => change all quote insets to single quotes, keeping style and level
  "inset-forall Quotes inset-modify changetype g.s"
   => change all quote insets to German single quotes, keeping left/right setting

* word-delete-forward, word-delete-backward, char-delete-forward,
  char-delete-backward
  The pre-2.3 behavior of these functions is equivalent to the 2.3 behavior with
  the "force" option appended. The new default behavior (without "force") is
  to select big insets on the first call and delete them only on the second.
  This new behavior is consistent with how delete works in LyX's math editor.

!!!The following LyX documents have been moved in 2.3:


!!!The following new folders have been added to the LyX directory

* citeengines: Contains the *.citeengine files that determine the citation
  formatting and features.

* xtemplates: Contains the *.xtemplate files that define the external templates
  (previously in the external_templates file).


!!!The following preferences files have been removed from the tarball in 2.3:

* external_templates. This files has been split into multiple *.xtemplate
  files that are now shipped as content of the xtemplates directory.


!!!The following metadata files have been added to the tarball in 2.3:


!!Changes with respect to external programs and libraries in 2.3:

* Inkscape SVG with separate LaTeX + PDF output is experimentally supported.

* Add some editor/viewer applications to (re)configure checks.


!!Known issues in version 2.3.0


!!Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 2.3.x

* The external_templates file has been split into one file per template,
  which are now located in lib/xtemplates/*.xtemplate. This makes it easier
  to add new templates or modify existing ones. If you have modified
  the external_templates file, you will have to move the modifications to
  the respective *.xtemplate file manually.

* If using TeX fonts and en- and em-dashes are output as font ligatures,
  when exporting documents containing en- and em-dashes to the format of
  LyX 2.0 or earlier, the following line has to be manually added to the
  unicodesymbols file of that LyX version:<br>
  0x200b "\\hspace{0pt}" "" "" "" "" # ZERO WIDTH SPACE<br>
  This avoids "uncodable character" issues if the document is actually
  loaded by that LyX version. LyX 2.1 and later versions already have the
  necessary definition in their unicodesymbols file.

* If trying to compile documents using R scripts and sweave/knitr, LyX
  2.3.x would not allow for re-running the R scripts, unless the user:
  1) explicitly disables the "Forbid use of needauth converters"
  option in the LyX preferences;
  2) provides explicit consent to the use of the converter on the first
  compilation of the R-enhanced document.
