\layout Title

Inventory of your LaTeX configuration
\layout Author

Automatically generated by LyX (do not edit).
\layout Date

@chk_date@
\layout Standard

This file describes the different LaTeX add-ons that LyX can handle.
 Below you'll find six sections:
\layout Enumerate

Some basic details about your LaTeX installation.
 In particular, you should make sure that your version of LaTeX is recent
 enough.
\layout Enumerate

Some common fonts that LyX knows about.
 This is rather sparse at the moment.
\layout Enumerate

The document classes that should be standard on any LaTeX implementation.
 This section is only here for completeness.
\layout Enumerate

Some optional document classes that LyX knows about.
 If one of these is marked as missing (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Found
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 item is no) and you need its functionality, you can grab it at your nearest
 CTAN ftp site
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

The participating hosts in the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network are:
\layout LyX-Code

ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive
\layout LyX-Code

ftp://ctan.tug.org/tex-archive
\layout LyX-Code

ftp://ftp.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive
\layout Standard

There are also a zillion mirror sites which are listed at the three primary
 sites.
\end_float 
 at the location indicated in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

CTAN
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 item.
 Note that only detected document classes can be selected as document layouts
 in LyX.
\layout Enumerate

Some packages that LyX uses when you try to change the margins of your document.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available
 inside LyX.
\layout Enumerate

Some common LaTeX packages that you might need with LyX, and you might also
 want to add to your LaTeX installation.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available
 inside LyX.
\layout Standard

Note that most of these packages will be available if you use a modern TeX
 distribution such as teTeX.
 If you decide to install one of the missing items, you should tell LyX
 about it.
 After the installation, please use the menu entry 
\family sans 
\bar under 
O
\bar default 
ptions\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
R
\bar default 
econfigure
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

or, if you want to change the system-wide settings, issue the command 
\family typewriter 
./configure
\family default 
 from the LyX system directory (by default 
\family typewriter 
/usr/local/lib/lyx/
\family default 
)
\end_float 
 and reload this file to see if the new package was recognized.
 If the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Found
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 items read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

???
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, it means that LyX could not do the inventory of your LaTeX configuration
 for some reason.
 If you are using teTeX, it might be that the new package you installed
 is not found.
 This is because you forgot to run the command 
\family typewriter 
texhash
\family default 
, which tells teTeX to update its own configuration.
\layout Section

LaTeX version currently in use
\layout Standard

The LaTeX version that LyX will use is: 
\family typewriter 
@chk_fmtversion@
\family default 
.
 Note that, for best results, you should be using at least LaTeX release
 
\family typewriter 
1995/12/01
\begin_float footnote 
\layout Standard

In case it is not clear to you, this number is the date at which the version
 has been released.
\end_float 
.
 In fact, earlier versions may work for many things, but will certainly
 fail in some cases.
 We feel that it is better to stick to a minimal version than try to work
 around all the quirks of older ones.
\layout Section

Fonts
\layout Subsection

EC fonts
\layout Description

\layout Description

CTAN:

\layout Description

Notes: LaTeX does not require the use of 
\family sans 
ec
\family default 
 fonts, however they are strongly recommended.
 The 
\family sans

on and kerning than the old fonts such as 
\family sans 
cmr10
\family default 
.

\family sans

 They are used automatically if LyX determines that you have them installed.

Paper layout packages
\layout Standard

Changing the margins of a document is one thing people like to do.
 While LaTeX offers built-in options to set the margins of the documents,
 some people feel that these margins are too large and want to set them
 up differently.
 You can use the package

 should not contain more than 60-70 characters.
