\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual is essentially Part II of the 
\emph on
User's Guide\SpecialChar endofsentence

\emph default
 The reason for separating the two documents is simple: the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 is already quite lengthy, and it contains information on all of the basic
 features one needs to know in order to prepare most documents.
 However, the \SpecialChar LyX
 Team has worked to make \SpecialChar LyX
 extensible through various configuration
 files and external packages.
 That means that if you want to support the Fizzwizzle \SpecialChar LaTeX
 package, you can
 create a layout file (or module) for it without having to alter \SpecialChar LyX
 itself.
 We've already had contributions of several new features this way, and some
 of them are documented here.
 There are also some more `advanced' features, such as how to control the
 presentation of bibliographies and how to work with multi-part documents,
 that are not covered in the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 and are discussed here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual also documents some special features, like fax support, version
 control, and SGML support, which require additional software to work properly.
 There is also a chapter on \SpecialChar LyX
's support for HTML.
 And lastly, there's a chapter of \SpecialChar LaTeX
 tools and tips, things you can use to
 spruce up your documents by directly using the powerful features of \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 After all, \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 only WYSIWYM and will only ever interface to some, not all, \SpecialChar LaTeX
 features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you haven't read the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 yet, you are definitely in the wrong manual.
 The 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 is the first place to go, since it describes the notation and format of
 all of the manuals.
 You should also be thoroughly familiar with the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 and all of the basic features of \SpecialChar LyX
 before attempting to read this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since many of the topics in this manual depend heavily on \SpecialChar LyX
's interaction
 with \SpecialChar LaTeX
, this first chapter covers the inner workings of \SpecialChar LyX
 and how to direct
 \SpecialChar LyX
 to generate exactly the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code you want.
 It is obviously for more seasoned \SpecialChar LyX
 users.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
\SpecialChar LyX
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How \SpecialChar LyX
 Uses \SpecialChar LaTeX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This chapter is for both \SpecialChar TeX
-nicians and the \SpecialChar LaTeX
-curious.
 In it, we'll explain how \SpecialChar LyX
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX
 work together to produce printable output.
 This is the only place in any of the manuals where we assume you know something
 about \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At one time, \SpecialChar LyX
 was called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WYSIWYM frontend to \SpecialChar LaTeX
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but that's no longer true.
 There are frontends to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 out there.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Some familar ones are \SpecialChar TeX
maker and kile, on Linux, and \SpecialChar TeX
shop, OSX.
 There are also the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 modes for vi and emacs, of course.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 These are basically text editors with the ability to run \SpecialChar LaTeX
 and mark any
 errors in the file you're editing.
 Although \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 an editor, and it 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 run \SpecialChar LaTeX
, and it also indicates errors in the file, it also does much, much
 more.
 For one thing, you don't need to know \SpecialChar LaTeX
 to use \SpecialChar LyX
 effectively.
 And \SpecialChar LyX
 has added its own extensions to \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 Try the following sometime: select 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Export\SpecialChar menuseparator
LaTeX
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 menu (or 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
View\SpecialChar menuseparator
Source
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Pane
\end_layout

\end_inset

), then look at the preamble of the resulting 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file.
 You'll notice a variety of new macros defined specifically by \SpecialChar LyX
.
 These macros are defined automatically, according to the features you use
 in the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several commands that automatically invoke \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
View
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Update
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They will only invoke \SpecialChar LaTeX
 if the file has changed since the last time \SpecialChar LaTeX
 was
 run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When \SpecialChar LyX
 runs \SpecialChar LaTeX
 on the file you're editing, it performs these steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Convert the document to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 and save to a file with the extension 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Run \SpecialChar LaTeX
 on the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file (maybe several times), and run any other commands (such as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bibtex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
makeindex
\end_layout

\end_inset

) needed to compile the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If there are any errors, show the error log.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have run \SpecialChar LaTeX
 using 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
View\SpecialChar menuseparator
DVI
\end_layout

\end_inset

, \SpecialChar LyX
 then runs a DVI viewer to display the DVI-file.
 If you have used 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
View\SpecialChar menuseparator
PostScript
\end_layout

\end_inset

, \SpecialChar LyX
 performs further steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Run 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
dvips
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to convert the DVI file to PostScript.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Run a PostScript viewer, such as 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ghostview
\end_layout

\end_inset

, to display the PostScript file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 does similar things when viewing, or exporting, other formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Translating \SpecialChar LaTeX
 files into \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can import a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file into \SpecialChar LyX
 by using the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
Import\SpecialChar menuseparator
LaTeX
\end_layout

\end_inset

 command in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 This will call a program named 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 which will create a file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
foo.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 from the file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
foo.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will then open that file.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 can also be run from the command line, of course.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 will translate most legal \SpecialChar LaTeX
, but not everything.
 It will put things it doesn't understand into \SpecialChar TeX
 code, so after translating
 a file with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

, you can look for \SpecialChar TeX
 code and hand-edit it until it looks right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't know what \SpecialChar TeX
 code is, read the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\end_inset

Inserting \SpecialChar TeX
 Code into \SpecialChar LyX
 Documents 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anything you can do in \SpecialChar LaTeX
 you can do in \SpecialChar LyX
, for a very simple reason: You can
 always insert \SpecialChar TeX
 code into any \SpecialChar LyX
 document.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 cannot, and will never be able to, display every possible \SpecialChar LaTeX
 construct.
 If ever you need to insert \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands into your \SpecialChar LyX
 document, you can use the
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar TeX
 Code
\end_layout

\end_inset

 box, which you can insert into your document with 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator

\end_layout

\end_inset

 or the keyboard shortcut 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "ert-insert"
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example of inserting \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands in a \SpecialChar LyX
 document.
 The code looks like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_inset Newline newline

This is an example of a minipage environment.
 You 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

can put nearly everything in it, even (non-floating) 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

figures and tables.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to using \SpecialChar TeX
 code, you can also create a separate file containing
 some complex \SpecialChar LaTeX
 structure and then use 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator
Child
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Document
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to include your file (you should select the type 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Input
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 We recommend that you only do this if you have a 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file which you 
\emph on
know
\emph default
 works already.
 Otherwise, you'll have a big job tracking down \SpecialChar LaTeX
 errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few last points to emphasize:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
does not
\emph default
 check if your \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Beware of reinventing the wheel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On that last point, \SpecialChar LyX
 does have quite a few features tucked into it, and
 more are coming.
 Be sure to check the manuals to make sure that \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't have such-and-such
 feature before you decide you have to do it by hand.
 Moreover, there are numerous \SpecialChar LaTeX
 packages out there to do all sorts of things,
 from labels to envelopes to fancy multipage tables.
 Check out 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CTAN"
target "http://www.ctan.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you do need to do some wild and fancy things within your document, be
 sure to check out a good \SpecialChar LaTeX
 book for assistance.
 There are a number of them listed in the bibliography of the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
\SpecialChar LyX
 and the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
About the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you already know \SpecialChar LaTeX
, there is no need to explain here what the preamble
 is good for.
 If you don't, the following will give you some ideas—we recommend again
 that you consult a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 book for further information.
 In any case, you should read the points below, because they explain what
 you can do and what you don't need to do in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble of a \SpecialChar LyX
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble comes at the very beginning of a document, 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the text.
 It serves to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare the document class.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\SpecialChar LyX
 already does this for you.
 If you're a seasoned \SpecialChar LaTeX
-nician, and you have a custom document class you
 want to use, check out the 
\emph on
Customization Manual
\emph default
 for information on how to make \SpecialChar LyX
 interface to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare the usage of packages.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

\SpecialChar LaTeX
 packages provide special commands, which are only available within a document
 when the package has been declared in the preamble.
 In addition to providing special commands, the inclusion of a package can
 change the document.
 For example, the package 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
indentfirst
\end_layout

\end_inset

 forces all paragraphs to be indented.
 There are other packages for labels, envelopes, margins, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Set counters, variables, lengths and widths.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

There are several \SpecialChar LaTeX
 counters and variables that 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 be set globally from within the preamble in order to have the desired effect.
 (There are variables that you can set and reset inside the document, too.)
 Margins are a good example of something that must be set in the preamble.
 Another example is the label format for lists.
 You can actually set these just about anywhere, but it's best to do it
 just once, inside the preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Declare user defined commands (with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
newcommand
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
renewcommand
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

These are abbreviations for \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands which appear very often inside a document.
 Although the preamble is a good place to declare such commands, they 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 be declared anywhere (before they are used for the first time, of course).
 This can be useful if there is a lot of raw \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code in your document, which
 normally should not be the case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 adds its own set of definitions to the preamble of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file it produces.
 This makes \SpecialChar LaTeX
 files generated by \SpecialChar LyX
 portable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Changing the Preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The commands which \SpecialChar LyX
 adds to the preamble of a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file are fixed; you can't
 change them without patching \SpecialChar LyX
 itself.
 You can, however, add your own stuff to the preamble by selecting 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Preamble
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\end_layout

\end_inset

 dialog.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 adds anything in the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Preamble
\end_layout

\end_inset

 dialog to its own built-in preamble.
 Before adding your own declarations in the preamble, you should make sure
 that \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't already support what you want to do.
 (Remember what we said about reinventing the wheel?) Also, 
\emph on
make sure your preamble code is correct
\emph default
.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't check it for you.
 If there is an error, you're likely to get an error like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Missing 
\backslash
begin{document}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If you see this error, check your preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some examples of what you can add to a preamble, and what they
 do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #1: Offsets
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two variables under \SpecialChar LaTeX
 that control page position: 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
voffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Their names should be self-explanatory.
 These variables are useful if you think for a moment about computer labels.
 Sometimes, the size of a print medium and the area of the medium that you
 can actually print on aren't the same.
 This is where 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
hoffset
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

 come in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Example #2: Labels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of labels, suppose you wanted to print out a bunch of address labels.
 There's a rather nice package, available at your nearest CTAN archive,
 for printing sheets of labels: 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
labels.sty
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Now, your system may not have this package installed by default.
 We leave that up to you to check.
 You'll also want to read the documentation for it; we're not going to do
 that for you.
 Since this is an example, however, we'll give you an example of how you
 use this package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, make sure you're using the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 document class.
 Next, you need to put the following in your preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{labels}
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
LabelCols=3
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

Example #3: Paragraph Indentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Americans are trained to indent the first line of 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 paragraph.
 As with all of their other weird quirks, most Americans will whine and
 moan until they can have their way and indent the first line of all paragraphs.
 (Yes, we're joking.
 (We are?) 
\emph on
Yeah
\emph default
, we are.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, this behavior isn't standard typography.
 In books, you typically only indent the first line of a paragraph 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 it follows another one.
 The idea behind indenting the first line of a paragraph is to distinguish
 neighboring paragraphs from one another.
 If there is no previous paragraph—for example, if it follows a figure or
 is the first paragraph in a section—then there is no need for indentation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're a typical American (we're still joking!), though, you don't care
 about such esoteric things; you want your indentation! Add this to the
 preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{indentfirst}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your \SpecialChar TeX
 distribution isn't braindead, you'll have this package, and all
 of your paragraphs will get the indentation the Founding Fathers intended
 they should have.

\begin_layout Section
\SpecialChar LyX
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX
 Errors
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When \SpecialChar LyX
 calls \SpecialChar LaTeX
, it tells \SpecialChar LaTeX
 to blithely ignore any errors and keep going.
 It then uses the logfile from the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 run to do a post-mortem.
 After analyzing the logfile, \SpecialChar LyX
 displays a dialog listing the errors.
 Clicking on any one of them will take you to the position in your \SpecialChar LyX
 file
 where the error occurred.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Well, usually.
 Analyzing the logfile is a tough job, and \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't always go to the right
 line.
 There are also cases where \SpecialChar LaTeX
 reports the error on one line, but the actual
 error is earlier.
 This is not unlike forgetting a closing brace in a program: You'll get
 an error, but only later.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some folks also like to look at the log file directly: It is available from

All right, you didn't use any of the fine-tuning options, you played by
 the rules.
 Did you try to pull a fancy maneuver? Did you do something funky inside
 a table or an equation, like inserting a graphic into a table cell?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Do you have long sections of text where \SpecialChar LaTeX
 cannot find a place to break a
 line? By default, \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is rather strict about how much extra inter-word spacing
 it will add in order to break a line.
 Preferably, you should rework the paragraph to avoid the problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Did you go overboard with the nesting? \SpecialChar LyX
 (currently) doesn't check to make
 sure you're in the limits for nesting environments.
 If you nested a bunch of environments to the

 is five.)

\begin_layout Enumerate

 or if you want to use one of the countless style files for 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_inset Flex Code

 If you look for specific citation styles common in law studies, you might
 consider the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_inset

 package.
 If you want to have full control over the formatting or look for advanced
 features such as ibidem, footnote citations, full title citations, advanced

 English, you should definitely consider 
\begin_inset Flex Code

) is that you don't need to define new citation commands.
 Instead, you need to prepare different bibliographic databases which include
 the entries for the different sections of the bibliography.
 For example: If you want to divide your bibliography into the sections
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scientific works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you first need to create two bibliographic databases, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
sources.bib

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Go to 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

Settings
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and check under 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Bibliography
\end_layout

\end_inset

 the option 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Subdivided bibliography
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Now you can insert multiple Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 bibliographies, one for each section of
 your bibliography.
 Returning to our example: Insert the Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 bibliography 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
sources.bib
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and a second one for the database 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
scientific.bib
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 You are free to use the same or different styles for each section.
 Additionally, you can choose if the bibliography section should contain
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all cited references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the specified database(s) (which is the default), 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all uncited references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or even 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all references
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This might be useful if you would like to separate your bibliography into
 three sections: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cited sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Uncited sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Scientific works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The titles for the sections can be added as ordinary sections or subsections.
 Since 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bibtopic
\end_layout

\end_inset

 removes the bibliography title, you have to manually re-add that, too (as
 a chapter* or section*, for instance).
\end_layout

 Note that this approach has some limitations.
 First, every citation reference has to be inside some 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 So citations outside a defined unit (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

by section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) will appear as

 You can also create your own units by entering

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 Note, though, that 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 A second limitation is that 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bibtopic
\end_layout

\end_inset

 always processes all references of a bibliography database, even if they
 are not cited.
 This can result in odd labels (e.

g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
When you are working on a large file with many sections, it is often convenient
 to break up the document into several files, or perhaps you have something
 where a table may change from time to time, but the preceding text does
 not.
 In these cases, you should seriously consider using multipart documents.
 For example, scientific papers often have five major sections: the introduction
, observations, results, discussion, and conclusion.
 Each of these could be its own separate \SpecialChar LyX
 file, with one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

master
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file which contains the title, authors, abstract, references, etc., plus
 the five included files.
 It is important to note that each of these files is a full \SpecialChar LyX
 file which
 can be formatted and printed on its own, as well as included in a master
 file.
 Each of these files must have the same document class, however—don't attempt
 to mix book classes with article classes.
 You may also include \SpecialChar LaTeX
 files; however, these files must not have their own
 preamble (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

everything up to and including the

If you work with child documents, you might want to have only one main bibliogra
phy at the end, but still be able to have a selected bibliography for the
 child if you output it on its own.
 Here is how to achieve this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -712698321 1501227105
For the main document, you just insert a bibliography inset at the place
 where the main bibliography has to appear (within the master file or within
 a child).
 If the bibliography inset is in the master file, the references will be
 inherited by all children, so they are available in the citation dialog
 within each child.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -712698321 1501227910
For child-specific bibliographies, insert bibliography insets within the
 child documents, at the place where the bibliography should appear when
 the child is compiled separately.
 However, the trick is to insert them into a branch (
\family sans

Branch\SpecialChar menuseparator

\family default
), e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Childonly
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Within the children, activate the branch (
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings...\SpecialChar menuseparator
Branches
\family default
).
 Within the master, deactivate the branch (
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings...\SpecialChar menuseparator
Branches
\family default
).
 Now the child's bibliography will be ignored by the master, but considered
 by the child.

 These settings are document-wide so you won't be able to specify different

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dialog provides you with a table of bullet shapes.
 A column of buttons on the left of the table provides access to the six
 different panels of bullet shapes.
 The row of buttons across the top is used to select which bullet depth
 you are changing.
 A text entry under the table shows the currently selected bullet shape's
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 equivalent and this can be edited if desired.
 If you do modify the text you will also need to specify any needed packages
 in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The six panels are divided up by the packages they require.
 The following table shows the mappings from button name to \SpecialChar LaTeX

 These fall into two large groups: there are converters that use \SpecialChar LaTeX

, and 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

, relying upon \SpecialChar LyX
 to produce the \SpecialChar LaTeX
; and there is a converter that works directly
 on \SpecialChar LyX
 files, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
e\SpecialChar LyX
er
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 All of these have different advantages and disadvantages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The \SpecialChar LaTeX
-based converters have the advantage that, in principle, they know everythin
g about the exported document that \SpecialChar LaTeX
 does.
 Such converters do not care, for example, if a certain block of code was
 produced by \SpecialChar LyX
 or was Evil Red Text.
 These converters know about 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
aux
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files, counters, and references, and can often make use of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
bbl
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files generated by Bib\SpecialChar TeX
.
 On the other hand, \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is a very hard language to parse—it is sometimes said
 that only \SpecialChar TeX
 itself understands \SpecialChar TeX
—and \SpecialChar LaTeX
-based converters will often choke on
 what seem to be quite simple constructs; complex ones can throw them completely
, and as of this writing, for example, the 
\emph on
Embedded Objects
\emph default
 manual will not export with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
htlatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

, though the others will.
 The other issue concerns how math is handled.
 These converters typically convert the formulae into little pictures that
 are then linked from the HTML document.
 Since these are actually generated by \SpecialChar LaTeX
, they are accurate.
 But they do not scale well, and just getting them to look as if they are
 actually meant to be in your document—so that the font sizes seem to be
 roughly the same—can be a challenge.

 In particular, the formulae it produces scale perfectly, since it renders
 math using a combination of HTML and CSS rather than converting the formulae
 to images.
 But even moderately complex formula are rendered less well than with 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 have decided to follow a different path and have made \SpecialChar LyX
 itself capable of
 writing XHTML, just as it is capable of writing \SpecialChar LaTeX
, DocBook, and plaintext.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of this writing, XHTML output remains under development and should probably
 be regarded as

literal "false"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Still, the developers have chosen this approach because it has several
 potential advantages over the other two.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These advantages are primarily due to the fact that the XHTML output routines,
 since they are part of \SpecialChar LyX
, know everything \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about the document being
 exported.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another advantage is that, since these routines are internal to \SpecialChar LyX
, they are
 immune to changes in \SpecialChar LyX
's file format, or to changes in the semantics of
 existing insets.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 So they know about the table of contents (as displayed in the outline),
 about the counters associated with different paragraph styles, and about
 user-defined styles.
 The XHTML output routines know what \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about internationalization,
 too, so they will output 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Chapter 1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\lang ngerman
Kapitel
\lang english

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, depending upon the language in effect at the time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quite generally, the output routines know what \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about document layout,
 that is, about how the document is to be rendered on screen.
 We use this information when we output the document as XHTML.
 In particular, \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
automatically
\emph default
 generates CSS style information corresponding to the layout information
 it uses to render the document on screen: if section headings are supposed
 to be sans-serif and bold as seen in \SpecialChar LyX
, then (by default) they will be sans-seri
f and bold when viewed in a web browser, too.
 And this is true not just for pre-defined styles, like Section, but for
 any style, including user-defined styles.
 Indeed, the XHTML output routines make no distinction between user-defined
 paragraph and character styles and \SpecialChar LyX
's own pre-defined styles: in each case,
 everything \SpecialChar LyX
 knows about the styles is contained in the layout files.
 And much the same is true as regards pre-defined textual insets, such as
 footnotes, and various custom insets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result is that XHTML output can be customized and extended in exactly
 the same way \SpecialChar LaTeX
 output can be customized and extended: through layout files
 and modules.
 See chapter five of the 
\emph on
Customization 
\emph default
manual for the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The remainder of this chapter contains more detailed information on XHTML
 output, its limitations, and ways to work around those limitations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Math Output in XHTML
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 offers four choices for how math is rendered.
 These have various advantages and disadvantages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
MathML
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

MathML is a dialect of XML designed specifically for mathematics on the
 web, and it typically renders very well in browsers that support it.
 The disadvantage is that not all browsers support MathML, and support is
 not complete even in the Gecko-based browsers, such as Firefox.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If \SpecialChar LyX
 is unable to render a formula as MathML—for example, if the formula
 uses the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
xymatrix
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package or ERT—then it will instead output the formula as an image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
HTML
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

As mentioned above, 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
elyxer
\end_layout

\end_inset

 outputs math as HTML, styled by CSS.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar LyX
 has borrowed some of the CSS for its HTML output from 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
elyxer
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For simple formulae, this can work quite well, though with more complicated
 formulae it tends to break down.
 Still, this method has the advantage that it is very widely supported and
 so it may be appropriate for documents that contain only a little, fairly
 simple math.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If Lyx is unable to render a formula as HTML—for example, if the formula
 uses the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
xymatrix
\end_layout

\end_inset

 package or ERT—then it will instead output the formula as an image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Images
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Like 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
htlatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

, \SpecialChar LyX
 will output formulae as images, the very same images, in fact, that are
 used for instant preview.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Instant preview does 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
have to be on for images to be output, however.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The advantage to this method is that the images are simply generated by
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
, so they are very accurate.
 The disadvantage, as mentioned earlier, is that these are bitmapped images,
 so they do not scale terribly well, and one cannot copy them, etc.

For those who want to know, this controls the resolution of the image in
 dots per inch and is based upon a default of 75 dpi.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If \SpecialChar LyX
 for some reason fails to create an image for a formula (e.g., if a required
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 package is not installed), then it will fall back to outputing the raw
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Finally, \SpecialChar LyX
 will happily output math as \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 As well as being the output of last resort, this method can be used with
 such tools as 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "jsMath"
target "http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which uses JavaScript to render \SpecialChar LaTeX
 embedded in HTML documents.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 wraps the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 in either a 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
span
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (for inline formulas) or 
\begin_inset Flex Code

.
 By default, \SpecialChar LyX
 outputs MathML.
 This is a document-wide setting, therefore.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eventually, \SpecialChar LyX
 will offer the user the option to select an alternate output
 method for a particular inset, say, one that isn't being rendered very
 well by MathML.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That said, since \SpecialChar LyX
 falls back to images if the inset contains ERT, then one
 can force output as an image by putting some harmless ERT into the math,
 for example: 
\begin_inset Formula $a=b\relax$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Bibliography and Citations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
XHTML output fully supports bibliographies and citations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citation labels are generated by the same machinery that generates \SpecialChar LyX
's on-screen
 labels, so the labels will look in the output much as they do in \SpecialChar LyX
, though
 better.
 If you are using numerical citations, then \SpecialChar LyX
 will output numerical labels,
 such as [1] or [17], rather than simply showing the citation key in square
 brackets, as it does on-screen.
 If you are using author-year citations, then \SpecialChar LyX
 will add lowercase letters
 to the years, just as Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 does, if it finds more than one citation for
 a given author-year combination.
 The labels will be printed with the bibliography entries.
 Note that there is, at present, no way to customize the appearance of the
 labels, for example, to choose between square brackets and parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Bibliography output is handled by the same machinery that handles the presentati
on of reference information in the citation dialog, so you will see in the
 XHTML output pretty much what you would see if you were to look at a given
 entry in the citation dialog.
 The formatting can be customized in your layout file or, preferably, in
 a module.
 See the 
\emph on
Customization
\emph default
 manual for the details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main defect at present is that cross-referenced information is printed
 with every entry with which it is associated.
 So you can see things like this:

\begin_layout Standard
This should be fixed before long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is no support at present for sectioned bibliographies.
 If you have multiple bibliographies, then \SpecialChar LyX
 will print the same bibliography
 over and over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Indexes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 will happily export indexes as XHTML, but with certain limitations at the
 moment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Index export will be most reliable when you do not attempt to use the fancy
 constructs that are described in the section on indexes in the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The main issue here is that \SpecialChar LyX
 itself does not really handle these.
 It just lets you enter what you would have to enter in raw \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We'll describe how they are handled using the subsection headings from
 that section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Grouping Index Entries (aka, sub-entries): \SpecialChar LyX
 makes an effort to support these,
 but the entries must be separated by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 ! 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, that is, there must be spaces around the exclamation point.
 This is because it is otherwise too difficult to check for escaped exclamation
 points, ones in math, and so forth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Page Ranges: There is no support at all for page ranges, since these make
 no sense with XHMTL.
 Instead, you will just get two index entries, one at either end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cross-referencing: There is no support for cross-referencing.
 If \SpecialChar LyX
 finds an entry containing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

|see\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 construct, it is just dropped, and the rest is treated as an ordinary index
 entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index Entry Order: \SpecialChar LyX
 does support attempts to fix the sorting order.
 It will take what is before the first `@' it finds and use that for sorting,
 taking what follows the first `@' to be the actual entry.
 At present, \SpecialChar LyX
 does not check for escaped `@', so do not try to index email
 addresses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Index Entry Layout: You can format entries by using the text style dialog,
 or by using any other method available within \SpecialChar LyX
 itself.
 There is no support for constructs like: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entry|textbf
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, if \SpecialChar LyX
 finds a pipe symbol, `|', in an entry, it will delete it and
 everything that follows it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple Indexes: There is no support for multiple indexes.
 Rather, all index entries will be printed as one large index.
 To avoid our printing several versions of the index, we print only the
 main index, so make sure you have one.

\begin_layout Section
Nomenclature and Glossary

There is at present no support for glossaries.
 Adding it would be fairly trivial, and welcome.

 commands, and retrieve
 information about the \SpecialChar LyX
 internal state.
 This is only intended for advanced users, but they should find it useful.
 It is by writing to the \SpecialChar LyX

\begin_layout Section
Normal communication

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
clientname is a name that the client can choose arbitrarily.
 Its only use is that \SpecialChar LyX
 will echo it if it sends an answer—so a client can
 dispatch results from different requesters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
function is the function you want \SpecialChar LyX
 to perform.
 It is the same as the commands you'd use in the minibuffer.
\end_layout

argument is an optional argument which is meaningful only to some functions
 (for instance, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self-insert
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LFUN will insert the argument as text at the cursor position).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The answer from \SpecialChar LyX
 will arrive in the output pipe and be of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
INFO:
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
:
\emph on

\emph default
:
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
clientname
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 are just echoed from the command request, while 
\emph on
data
\emph default
 is more or less useful information filled according to how the command
 execution worked out.
 Some commands, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

font-state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, will return information about the internal state of \SpecialChar LyX
, while other will
 return an empty data-response.
 This means that the command execution went fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In case of errors, the response from \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
ERROR:

\begin_layout Subsection
AppleScript (Mac OS X)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1, \SpecialChar LyX
 supports basic interactions with AppleScript for normal communicatio
n through the command run.
 This command takes a direct argument (the 
\series bold
function
\series default
 to perform) and an optional argument.
 It either returns the output of the function or triggers an error with
 the error message and code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Section
Notification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 can notify clients of events going on asynchronously.
 Currently it will only do this if the user binds a key sequence with the
 function 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The format of the string \SpecialChar LyX
 sends is as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
NOTIFY:
\end_layout

\end_inset


\emph on
key-sequence
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\emph on
key-sequence
\emph default
 is the printed representation of the key sequence that was actually typed
 by the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This mechanism can be used to extend \SpecialChar LyX
's command set and implement macros.
 Bind some key sequence to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

notify
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Then start a client that listens on the output pipe, dispatches the command
 according to the sequence, and starts a function that may use \SpecialChar LyX
 calls and
 \SpecialChar LyX
 requests to issue a command or a series of commands to \SpecialChar LyX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\begin_layout Section
Reverse DVI/PDF search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some DVI/PDF viewers
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The following viewers offer the reverse PDF search feature: Okular on KDE/Linux,
 Qpdfview on Unix, Skim on Mac OSX and SumatraPDF on Windows.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 provide 
\emph on
reverse search
\emph default
 facility (also called 
\emph on
inverse search
\emph default
).
 This means that you can tell \SpecialChar LyX
 to put the cursor to a specific line in the
 document by clicking at the respective position in the DVI/PDF output.
 To achieve this, the viewer must be able to communicate with \SpecialChar LyX
.
 This is done via the \SpecialChar LyX
 server either by using the named pipe (
\emph on
lyxpipe
\emph default
), or the UNIX domain socket (
\emph on
lyxsocket
\emph default
) that \SpecialChar LyX
 creates in its temporary directory (this is the way the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lyxclient
\end_layout

\end_inset

 program communicates with \SpecialChar LyX
).
 In some cases, you need a helper script that mediates between the viewer
 and \SpecialChar LyX
, in others, the viewer can communicate with \SpecialChar LyX
 directly.
 This depends on the selected viewer and on your operating system.
 The same applies to the way viewers need to be configured and the way the
 reverse search is actually performed.
 In what follows, we will thus describe how to setup reverse search for
 specific viewers.
 Before we turn to this, though, we will explain what needs to be done generally
 to enable reverse search in the DVI/PDF output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Automatic setup
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In most cases \SpecialChar LyX
 will do the work for you by 
\change_inserted -712698321 1500975045
pressing the following button in the toolbar: 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "buffer-toggle-output-sync"
\end_inset

.
 Alternatively, you can also enable the feature by checking 
\family sans

\family default
 in 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

 In such a case \SpecialChar LyX
 will automatically insert the necessary Sync\SpecialChar TeX
 macro (for
 PDF) or load the srcltx package (for DVI) respectively.
 This option can be easily reached also on 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the method 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 If your viewer does not support it, you should instead use

.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Flex Code

 sometimes has an undesired impact on the typesetting.
 Thus, you should switch output synchronization off for the final typesetting
 if you use the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Manual setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LaTeX
 provides several different methods for reverse search.
 Some are built-in in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
latex/pdflatex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 program, some are provided by external packages.
 Your choice depends on whether your \SpecialChar LaTeX
 distribution already provides a given
 method (the built-in methods are rather new) and whether your viewer can
 cope with it.
 The available methods are described in the following.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Built-in DVI-search via src-specials (DVI only) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method provides the DVI file with the necessary information for reverse
 search.
 It is available in \SpecialChar LaTeX
 since quite some time (any somewhat recent \SpecialChar LaTeX
 distribution
 should include it), and it works reliably.
 To enable it, change the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
La
\family sans
TeX
\family default
 (plain)->DVI
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or

Converters
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
latex -src-specials $$i
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If this doesn't work, check if your \SpecialChar TeX
 engine needs different options (the
 syntax might differ in some distributions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
External Packages (PDFSync and scrltx) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The packages 
\emph on
pdfsync
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
scrltx
\emph default
 provide reverse search facility for PDF output (via pdflatex) and DVI output,
 respectively.
 In order to enable it, load the packages in the \SpecialChar LyX
 preamble: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
usepackage{pdfsync}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for reverse PDF search,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
usepackage[active]{srcltx}
\end_layout

\end_inset

 for reverse DVI search.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to be able to perform both DVI and PDF reverse searches, you
 can also insert in the preamble the following lines
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\backslash
usepackage{ifpdf}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
ifpdf
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

  
\backslash
usepackage{pdfsync}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
else
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

  
\backslash
usepackage[active]{srcltx}
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\backslash
fi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This way, you can preview the file as either DVI or PDF (pdflatex) and the
 right package will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that PDFSync might affect the output layout of your document.
 It is therefore advised to disable PDFsync for final documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Built-in reverse search via Sync\SpecialChar TeX
 (DVI and PDF) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent versions of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
(pdf)latex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 have built-in support for both PDF and DVI reverse search.
 This so-called 
\emph on
Sync\SpecialChar TeX

\emph default
 facility is basically the result of the integration of the PDFSync package
 to the pdftex program and its merge with the 
\emph on
scr-specials
\emph default
 approach.
 You need at least \SpecialChar TeX
Live 2008 or a recent Mik\SpecialChar TeX
 distribution in order to use
 it.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For some reason, Mik\SpecialChar TeX
 does not understand/obey the command \SpecialChar LyX
 inserts into
 the preamble when you check the "Enable Forward/Reverse Search" button
 in the toolbar and does not generate the necessary info.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The generation of the required info can be forced by changing the converter
 "\SpecialChar LaTeX
 (pdflatex) -> PDF (pdflatex)" in Preferences->File handling->Converters
 from the default "pdflatex $$i" to "pdflatex -synctex=1 $$i" (i.e., by adding
 the -synctex=1 switch).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Also note that only a few PDF viewers (

\begin_layout Section
Forward search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forward search is, as the name implies, in a sense the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

opposite
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of reverse search.
 It allows you to let the viewer jump to a given position from within \SpecialChar LyX
.
 If forward search is set up (as described in what follows), you can put
 the cursor anywhere in your \SpecialChar LyX
 document, and hit 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Navigate\SpecialChar menuseparator
Forward search
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (or select 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Forward search
\end_layout

\end_inset

 in the context menu via right mouse click), and then the viewer will jump
 to that position as well.
 This implies, of course, that your viewer supports this function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make forward search possible, you first need to provide the generated
 output PDF/DVI file with additional information about the \SpecialChar TeX
 sources.
 This can be done via the methods described in the section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:rev-search"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additionally, you need to configure \SpecialChar LyX
 for using your viewers in 
\begin_inset Flex Noun

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Tools\SpecialChar menuseparator
Preferences\SpecialChar menuseparator
Output\SpecialChar menuseparator

\end_inset

.
 We provide a range of tested configurations for some viewers, which you
 can select from the drop down list.
 If none of these configurations suits you, you have to find out and enter
 a suitable configuration yourself.
 The definition syntax uses the following placeholders:

\end_layout

\end_inset

, require some extra tools in order to use forward search.
 While many of the widespread PDF viewers (most notably Adobe Reader) do
 not support forward search at all, some other viewers – e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 xpdf – allow at least to reload the document and jump to a specific page
 of the file, so you can at least navigate 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

near
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This latter functionality is provided by an external call of synctex (see
 the predefined example configurations).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forward search works both with DVI and PDF output.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 simply checks which preview format you have used before (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e., which format is already there in the temporary directory) and chooses
 the appropriate configuration for the respective format.

Please note that the publisher of the journal was changed from Springer

 That change involved also some slight changes to the style files, namely
 the removal of the thesaurus command.
 The \SpecialChar LyX

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 is a set of macros produced by the American Astronomical Society to
 facilitate electronic manuscript submission to the three journals they
 publish: the Astrophysical Journal (including the Letters and Supplement),
 the Astronomical Journal, and the Publications of the Astronomical Society
 of the Pacific.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 has proven to be an excellent tool for generating these documents, especially
 given its equation, citation, and figure handling capabilities.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 requires version 5.0 (or higher) of these macros; preferably 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501152764
5.2
\change_inserted -712698321 1501152766
6.0
\change_unchanged
, which is the version described here, or higher.
 Versions prior to 5.0 are intended for use with \SpecialChar LaTeX
2.09 and are fundamentally
 incompatible with \SpecialChar LyX
.
 The AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 package may be downloaded from the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 Web site

\begin_layout Standard
A complete user guide is contained in that package and you should familiarize
 yourself with it thoroughly before embarking on writing a paper in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will not reduce the need to figure out all the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 commands, it will only
 reduce the drudgery of typing everything in.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that the final exported \SpecialChar LaTeX
 document conforms
 completely to the requirements of the journal to which you are submitting
 your paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Starting a New Paper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I strongly suggest that you start with the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 template file.
 Click on 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
New from
\family default
 
\family sans
Template
\family default
, enter the new file name, then choose the 
\family typewriter
aastex
\change_inserted -712698321 1501152130
6
\change_unchanged
.lyx
\family default
 template.
 This will show the most common fields found in a manuscript.
 Simply overwrite the existing text (including the brackets, 
\family typewriter
<>
\family default
) with the correct information.
 Many of the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 commands and environments can be implemented directly in
 \SpecialChar LyX
, but some cannot
\change_deleted -712698321 1501152213
: most noticeably 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaffilmark
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaffiltext
\family default
, which should stick out like a sore thumb if you actually just opened the
 template file
\change_unchanged
.
 For commands such as these, the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code must be entered directly and marked
 as such.
 Such commands are referred to as \SpecialChar TeX
 code, or Evil Red Text.
 I tried to minimize the amount of \SpecialChar TeX
 code needed in an AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 document
\change_deleted -712698321 1501152220
, but there is still a bit more required than any of us would like
\change_unchanged

FAQs, Tips, Tricks, and Other Ruminations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Getting \SpecialChar LyX
 and AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 to cooperate
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It can be a bit tricky to get \SpecialChar LyX
 to recognize a new layout and document class.
 When all else fails, do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make certain that \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can find AAS\SpecialChar TeX
.
 Copy sample.tex (and perhaps table.tex) from the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 distribution into a
 directory completely unrelated to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 or AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 and run \SpecialChar LaTeX
 on 
\family typewriter
sample.tex
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make certain that 
\family typewriter
aastex.layout
\family default
 appears in \SpecialChar LyX
's 
\family typewriter
layouts
\family default
 folder
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Rerun 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar menuseparator
Reconfigure
\family default
 in \SpecialChar LyX
, then restart \SpecialChar LyX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Open a regular new file, not from a template.
 Does AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 appear in the class list in 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you get a warning from an existing AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 document about not being able
 to find the AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 layout or a message about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You should not mix title layouts with normal ones
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, things haven't been installed correctly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
\SpecialChar LaTeX
 error processing a table 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
, by default, attempts to center the table caption/title.
 This seems to produce a bad interaction in AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 so you should click somewhere
 in the caption/title, then select 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Paragraph
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Settings
\family default
, then set the 
\family sans
Alignment
\family default
 to 
\family sans
Block
\family default
.
 This took care of it for me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
References
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple of things: 1) I have noticed some funny spacing in the reference
 entries in the text.
 When you enter the bibliography item data, make sure their is 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 space between the last author and the parenthesis setting off the year;
 
\emph on
e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\emph default
type 
\family typewriter
Ressler(1992)
\family default
, not 
\family typewriter
Ressler (1992)
\family default
.
 2) Entering the references at all is not obvious.
 The easiest thing is to start typing your first reference at the end of
 the document, then mark it as type 
\family sans
References
\family default
.
 That will put a small gray box in front of what you just typed.
 Click on the box to fill in the rest of the information.
 For new references, go to the end of an existing reference and press return.
 That will create a new line with its own box, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Including EPS files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though AAS\SpecialChar TeX
 provides its own figure commands (
\family typewriter

\backslash
plotone
\family default
, for example), I much prefer \SpecialChar LaTeX
's standard figure commands (with the default
 graphicx).
 You can insert the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
plotone
\family default
, etc.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

commands as \SpecialChar TeX
 code into a Figure Float box if you desire, but I never have
 much luck getting the layout right.
 With the standard graphics, \SpecialChar LyX
 will insert a 
\family typewriter

\backslash
usepackage{graphicx}
\family default
 command into the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble and handle the figures in the standard \SpecialChar LaTeX2e
 way,
 interspersing the figures in the text.
 I believe ApJ accepts figures exactly this way now; AJ might still use
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stack everything at the end
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 technique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Things I could have done, but didn't
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 things I could have implemented, but chose not to.
 For instance, I saw no point in double-spacing the text in the \SpecialChar LyX
 window,
 even though it is double-spaced in the paper manuscript.
 Also, I chose not to make separate layouts for the preprint and preprint2
 styles.
 Since I assume you will spend most of your time in the plain manuscript
 mode anyway, I decided not to chew up more disk space with this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Final Caveat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your mileage may vary.
 I've now had papers published by both ApJ and AJ that have had 98% of the
 effort done in \SpecialChar LyX
; the last 2% was the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 post-processing and a few cleanups.
 I have had no trouble with the submission process, and I'm sure the journals
 were never aware that there might be a difference.
 So, go forth and publish!

\noindent
The AMS \SpecialChar LaTeX
 layouts are set up to conform to suggested styles for mathematical
 papers to be submitted to American Mathematical Society publications.
 The layouts are not tailored to a specific journal, but easily can be.
 You should refer to the AMS documentation for specific instructions for
 each journal (usually it will entail only changing a single line in the
 \SpecialChar TeX
 output).
 That documentation is available on the Web at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://www.ams.org
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or by ftp at 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These layouts are appropriate, and useful, for any mathematical writing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two basic AMS \SpecialChar LaTeX
 layouts: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
amsart: The standard AMS article format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
amsbook: the standard AMS book (really, monograph) format.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layouts themselves contain only the minimum necessary to use the AMS
 classes.
 They do not, in particular, contain any of the `theorem' environments used
 for setting theorems, lemmas, and the like.
 These are contained, instead, in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (AMS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module, which is loaded by default when you select one of the AMS classes.
 (It can also be used with other classes and can be removed, if you would
 rather use something else.) Less commonly used environments are in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (AMS-Extended)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module, which must be loaded manually.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, theorems and the like are numbered consecutively throughout
 the document, but this may be modified by loading the module 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Order by Section)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 or, if you are using 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
book (AMS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

, the module 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Order by Chapter)
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These will number the results as 
\begin_inset Formula $n.m$
\end_inset

, where the first number refers to the section (or chapter) and the second
 refers to the total number of results so far in that section (or chapter).
 Many environments are also available unnumbered.
 These are indicated by an asterisk at the end.
 If you happen to want 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 unnumbered results, the module 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Starred)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 provides that option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that these modules do not 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to be used with the AMS classes.
 It is perfectly possible to use the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (AMS)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module, and the others mentioned, with other classes, such as 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Subsection
What these layouts provide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a long list of included environments provided by these layouts.
 In AMS-\SpecialChar LaTeX

 of `theorem' environments.
 However, the AMS recommends the environments that are available in \SpecialChar LyX

 These same environments are provided only in the starred versions by the
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Theorems (Starred)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 module:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
This is typically used for the statements of major results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary*
This is used for statements which follow fairly directly from previous statement
s.
 Again, these can be major results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
These are smaller results needed to prove other statements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
These are less major results which (hopefully) add to the general theory
 being discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conjecture
These are statements provided without justification, which the author does
 not know how to prove, but which seem to be true (to the author, at least).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition*
Guess what this is for.
 The font is different for this environment than for the previous ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
Used for examples illustrating proven results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Problem
It's not really known what this is for.
 You should figure it out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise*
Write a description for this one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
This environment is also a type of theorem, usually a lesser sort of observation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Claim*
Often used in the course of giving a proof of a larger result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Case
Generally, these are used to break up long arguments, using specific instances
 of some condition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Case
The numbering scheme for cases is on its own, not together with other numbered
 statements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
At the end of this environment, a QED symbol (usually a square, but it can
 vary with different styles) is placed.
 If you want to have other environments within this one—for example, Case
 environments—and have the QED symbol appear only after them, then the other
 environments need to be nested within the proof environment.
 See the section 
\emph on
Nesting Environments
\emph default
 of the 
\emph on

 for information on nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And these environments are provided by 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Criterion*
A required condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Algorithm*
A general procedure to be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Axiom*
This is a property or statement taken as true within the system being discussed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Condition*
Sometimes used to state a condition assumed within the present context of
 discussion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Note*
Similar to a Remark.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Notation*
Used for the explanation of, yes, notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Summary
Do we really need to tell you? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Acknowledgement*
Acknowledgement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conclusion*
Sometimes used at the end of a long train of argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Fact
Used in a way similar to Proposition, though perhaps lower on the scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, the AMS classes automatically provide the AMS \SpecialChar LaTeX

 packages.
 They need to be available on your system in order to use these environments.

 If your machine doesn't have the 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 class 
\family sans
FoilTeX
\family default
 installed, you'll probably have to use the default 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class, which isn't quite as good as 
\family sans
foils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 class is designed for use with version
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2.1 of the 
\family sans
foils.cls
\family default
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 class file which is now an integral part of \SpecialChar LaTeX2e
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, to use this document class, you need to select 
\family sans

\family default
 from the 
\family sans
Class
\family default
 entry in the 
\family sans
Document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layout
\family default
 dialog.
 There are some settings in the 
\family sans
Document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Layout
\family default
 dialog that you should know about that are specific to this class:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't change the options 
\family sans
Sides
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Columns
\family default
 on the 
\family sans

\family default
 dialog.
 They're ignored by the 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font size is 20
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt with the other options being 17
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt, 25
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt and 30
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font is 
\family sans
sans
\family default
 
\family sans
serif
\family default
 but all math equations are still typeset in the usual roman font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 supports A4 and Letter paper sizes as well as a special size for working
 with 35
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm slides.
 It doesn't support A5, B5, legal or executive paper sizes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Don't bother changing the 
\family sans
Float Placement
\family default
 settings because they are ignored anyway.
 All floats appear where they are defined in the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family sans
Pagestyle
\family default
 setting behaves a bit differently for this class.
 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 provides extensive footer and header capabilities including a user-defined
 logo.
 See section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:foilfoot"

\end_inset

 for more details.
 The title page is treated differently to all other pages in the document
 and is 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 unnumbered and 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 has the logo centered at the bottom of the page (if one is defined).
 The possible page style choices and what they do are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\family sans
\series bold
empty
\family default
\series default
 The final output contains no page numbers, or other headers or footers
 (except footnotes of course).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\family sans
\series bold

 The final output contains page numbers centered at the bottom of the page.
 No other headings or footers (other than footnotes).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\series bold
foilheadings
\series default
 Page numbers in lower right corner.
 Additional headers and footers are also shown.
 This is also the default.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM

\series bold
fancy
\series default
 Gives you access to the 
\family sans
fancyheadings
\family default
 package although its use with 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 is discouraged by the writer of the 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 package because of some potential page layout clashes.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Subsubsection
Extra Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following options may be used in the extra class options in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
35mmSlide
\series default
 This sets up the page layout for 7.33
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

in by 11
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

in paper, which is about the same aspect ratio as a 35
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm slide, making it a bit easier to work with this medium.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
headrule
\series default
 Places a rule across the page below the header on every page except the
 title page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
footrule
\series default
 Places a rule across the page above the footer on every page except the
 title page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
dvips
\series default
 This is automatically set each time you create a new 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 document.
 This option tells 
\family sans
Foil\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 to use the dvips driver to rotate those pages that are set as landscape
 foils.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold
landscape
\series default
 Simply changes the page dimensions to those of a landscape page but doesn't
 do any rotation.
 Thus if you use this option you need to use an external program to rotate
 each page or feed your paper through your printer as landscape.
 Note that this option effectively reverses the roles of the 
\family sans
Foilhead
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Rotatefoilhead
\family default
 environments (don't worry these are described in the next section).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

\series bold

\series default
 Equation numbers on the left.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMx

That is, all the major environments apart from the sectioning environments.
 Since foils are essentially self-contained sections, with a title and body,

\begin_layout Subsection
Building a Set of Foils
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section will give a simple introduction to using the different environments
 to build a set of foils.
 If you want to see an example set of foils, take a look at the 
\family typewriter
Foils.lyx
\family default
 file you find in \SpecialChar LyX
's 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Give It a Title Page
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike other classes that provide 
\family sans
Title
\family default
, 
\family sans
Author
\family default
, 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environments, 
\family sans
foils
\family default
 creates the title on a page of its own.
 If you leave out the 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 environment \SpecialChar LaTeX
 will substitute the current date (every time you regenerate
 the output).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Start a New Foil
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I mentioned earlier, there are four ways of starting a new foil.
 For portrait foils you should use 
\family sans
Foilhead
\family default
 or 
\family sans
ShortFoilhead.

\family default
 The difference between these two environments is the amount of space between
 the title of the foil (the foilhead) and the body of the foil.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Landscape foils are generated using the 
\family sans
Rotatefoilhead
\family default
 and 
\family sans
ShortRotatefoilhead
\family default
 environments.
 Again the only difference is the spacing between foilhead and body.
 Both of the short versions have 0.5
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

inches less separation between the foilhead and the body.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One problem with the support for landscape foils is the requirement that
 you have to use the 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 driver to generate the PostScript output otherwise the foils won't be rotated.
 It is possible to get landscape foils even if you haven't got the 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 driver provided you can feed your foils sideways through your printer ;-)

\change_inserted -712698321 1501160182
If you use a normal paragraph break, 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501160188
They must be separated by something.
 If you try
\change_unchanged
, you will just be extending the previous environment as if you had merged
 the two environments together.
 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501160194
So, how do you get around this problem? The simplest option is to insert
 some text between the two environments or add a 
\family sans
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\family default
 environment between the two with just a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
%
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in it.
 This will force \SpecialChar LyX
 to produce two separate environments and hence the correct
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 output.
 An example is provided in the example file included with the \SpecialChar LyX
 distribution.
 Remember, this problem only occurs if you are trying to place two of the
 same type of theorem-like environments one directly after the other.

\change_inserted -712698321 1501160255
 Rather than that, you need to insert a so-called separator.

\begin_layout Standard
The two new list styles,

, are designed to make it easier for you to create lists of do's and don'ts
 or right and wrong by providing dedicated environments that use a tick
 or a cross as the label of the list.
 These lists are in fact dedicated variants of the 
\family sans

 They do however require that you have the

 Both journals are published by World Scientific.
 The corresponding document classes are named 
\family typewriter

The ijmpc and the ijmpd packages use the 
\family typewriter
tbl
\family default
 command to implement table captions.
 As a result, a table created by \SpecialChar LyX
 is printed correctly, but its caption
 is ignored.
 However, you can use some \SpecialChar TeX
 code to overcome this problem, so that captions
 are printed as expected.
 To do so, create a float table as usual, remove the caption, and replace
 it with the \SpecialChar TeX
 code 
\family typewriter

\backslash
tbl{
\emph on
your table caption
\emph default
}{
\family default
 (sic); you must also the \SpecialChar TeX
 code 
\family typewriter
}
\family default

 Study the example table included in the template files to see how this
 trick is implemented.
 Alternatively, If you need table captions, you should implement the whole
 table float in a 
\family typewriter

\family default
 file, then include this file to the \SpecialChar LyX
 document (

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The document class 
\emph on
letter (koma-script)
\emph default
 is implemented in the layout file 
\family typewriter
scrlettr.layout
\family default
.
 It contains all the paragraph types of the corresponding standard document
 class

, partly modified, with the exception of the \SpecialChar LyX
 specific types 
\family sans
\SpecialChar LyX

\family sans
Comment
\family default
 and the 
\family sans

\family default
 type, which is replaced by the new

 In addition, it contains, in contrast to the standard document class, the
 standard types

 Furthermore, there are a number of new letter specific types.

The appearance of the letter produced by this document class can be controlled
 by a number of \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands, which you can put in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 preamble.

For example, the standard appearance of the letter`s heading, consisting
 of name and address, is quite self-willed.

 A detailed German description of such \SpecialChar LaTeX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The types 
\family sans
Letter

in the left margin.
 It is possible to write any number of letters in one file.
 An

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It could be seen as a matter of inconsequence, that the types 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Opening
\family default
 described above are not such input types as well.
 Because of the special meaning of those types, however, I have implemented
 them as ordinary paragraph types with a one letter mark in the left margin.
 Moreover, it would affect my feeling of symmetry, if the 
\family sans
Opening
\family default
 type and the 
\family sans
Closing
\family default
 type had such a serious different appearance.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The types must be used ahead of the corresponding 
\family sans
Opening
\family default
 type.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An implementation of these types in a WYSIWYG fashion does not seem to make
 sense, because the real appearance of the produced letter does not only
 depend on the usage of the particular type, but also on other factors.
 For example, a signature entered in the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 type will in the standard behavior appear in the produced letter only,
 when in the same letter also a 
\family sans
Closing
\family default
 type is used.
 The entered value of the 
\family sans
Telephone
\family default
 type will in the standard behavior not appear in the produced letter at
 all.
 The possibility to design the letter`s heading freely is already indicated
 in a footnote above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The input types can also be used as empty paragraphs.
 This makes sense e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

for the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 type.
 If the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 type is not used at all, in the standard behavior the value of the 
\family sans
Name
\family default
 type is used as signature, whereas if an empty 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 type is used, no signature value is defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using the input types it is possible to write a letter template, containing
 filled input types with your personal dates (name, address, etc.) and empty
 input types for other dates you want to enter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Name
\family default
: sender's name, in the standard behavior appears as a centered paragraph
 in small caps in the letter`s heading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Signature
\family default
: sender's signature, in the standard behavior appears below the 
\family sans

 If no

\family default
 type appears instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans

\family default
: sender's address, in the standard behavior appears in a centered paragraph
 in the letter`s heading below the sender's name.
\end_layout

\family sans

\family default
 and 
\family sans

 If an empty 
\family sans

\family default
 type is used, neither place nor date appear, independent of the value of
 the 
\family sans

\family default
 type.
 If no 
\family sans

Koma-Script version 2.8 has introduced a new letter class 
\family typewriter
scrlttr2
\family default
 which supersedes the now unsupported 
\family typewriter
scrlettr
\family default
.
 It has — on the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 side — a completely new interface and is not compatible
 with the old class.
 Therefore, \SpecialChar LyX
 supports both, though it is recommended you use the new class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This class covers the same functionality as 
\emph on

\emph default
 and a few more.

\family sans

 in the old layout), 
\family sans

\family default

 will start a new letter (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

you can write several letters per document).
 New elements are sender's

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The biggest improvement is, though, that the letter's layout is configurable
 to meet almost any needs.
 This can be done via the preamble or with a special style file (Letter

\family typewriter
*.lco
\family default
), that will be read in as a class option.

 There is, for instance, a 
\family typewriter

 file that follows german typesetting rules, or a 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Itemize
The chapter number of a

 appearing in the same line ahead of it.
 The cause for that is the \SpecialChar LyX

 in the layout file.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The paragraphs in a

 This is the standard behavior, no special \SpecialChar LaTeX

 But in the

\family sans

 A 
\family sans

 to produce the gap, which is not what is wanted in this case.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memoir is a very powerful and constantly evolving class.
 It has been designed with regard to fictional and non-fictional literature.
 Its aim is to let the user have maximum control over the typesetting of
 his document.
 Memoir is based on the standard book class, but it can also emulate the
 article class (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peter Wilson, the developer of Memoir, is known as the author of lots of
 useful packages in the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 world.
 Most of them have been merged with Memoir.
 Therefore, it is much easier to layout the table of contents, appendices,
 chapter designs and such.
 \SpecialChar LyX
, though, does not support all of these goodies natively.
 Some of them might be added to forthcoming releases

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic features and restrictions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Memoir supports basically all features of the standard book classes.
 There are, however, some differences, as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Font
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

sizes: Memoir has a broader range of font sizes: 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

style: The fancy page style is not supported, due to a command clash between
 Memoir and the fancyhdr package (they both define a command with the same
 name, which confuses \SpecialChar LaTeX
).
 Instead, Memoir comes with a number of its own page styles (see 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501165256

).
 If you want to use these for the chapter pages, you have to use the command
 
\family typewriter

\backslash
chapterstyle
\family default
 in the main text or in preamble (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
chapterstyle{companion}
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Sectioning: Sectionings (chapter, section, subsection etc.) come with an
 optional argument in the standard classes.
 With this, you can specify an alternative version of the title for the
 table of contents and the headers (for instance, if the title is too long).
 In \SpecialChar LyX
, you can do this via 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar menuseparator
Short
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Title
\family default
 at the beginning of a chapter/section.
 Memoir features a second optional argument and thus separates the table
 of contents from the header.
 You can define three variants of a title with this: one for the main text,
 one for the table of contents, and one for the headers.
 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501165686
Simply insert two optional arguments if you need this feature, the first
 one containing the short title for the Table of Contents, the second one
 containing an alternative short title for the headers
\change_inserted -712698321 1501165708
\SpecialChar LyX
 makes these available in form of specific 
\family sans
Short Title
\family default
 variants in the 
\family sans
Insert
\family default
 menu
\change_unchanged
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
TOC/LOT/LOF: In the standard classes (and in many other classes), the table
 of contents, the list of figures and the list of table start a new page
 automatically.
 Memoir does not follow this route.
 You have to insert a page break yourself, if you want to have one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Titlepage: For some unknown reason, Memoir uses pagination on the title
 page (in the standard classes, title pages are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 If you want an empty title page, type 
\family typewriter

 That is, counters (footnotes, figures, tables etc.) will not be reset on
 new chapters, chapters don't start a new page (but are—in contrary to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 article classes—still allowed), parts, though, use their own page, as in
 book.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Oldfontcommands: By default, Memoir does not allow the use of the deprecated
 font commands, which have been used in the old \SpecialChar LaTeX
 version 2.09 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
rm
\family default
, 
\family typewriter

\backslash
it
\family default
).
 It produces an error and stops \SpecialChar LaTeX
 whenever such a command appears.
 The class option 
\emph on
oldfontcommands
\emph default
 reallows the commands and spits out warnings instead (which does at least
 not stop \SpecialChar LaTeX
).
 Since a lot of packages and particularly Bib\SpecialChar TeX
 style files are still using
 those commands, we have decided to use this option by default.

Abstract: You may wonder why an abstract is an extra feature.
 Well, it is in book class.
 Usually books don't have abstracts.
 Memoir, however, has.
 You can use it wherever and how often you like.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Chapterprecis: You may know this older typesetting style: The contents of
 a chapter are summarized below the title and also in the table of contents
 (e.

\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\emph on
Our hero arrives in Troia; he loses some friends; he finds others
\emph default
).
 Chapterprecis does exactly this.
 It is therefore only sensible below a chapter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Epigraph: An epigraph is a smart slogan or motto at the beginning of a chapter.
 The epigraph environment provides an elegant way of typesetting such a
 motto.
 The motto itself (text) and its 
\change_inserted -712698321 1501166968
(optional) 
\change_unchanged
author (source) are divided by a short line.

 a bit here again, since the environment
 needs two arguments (text and source).
 In this case, we have to use curly brackets (in \SpecialChar TeX
 mode) between the two
 arguments: 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\family typewriter
}{
\family default
 
\emph on
<author of the slogan>
\change_inserted -712698321 1501166996

\begin_layout Description
Poemtitle: Memoir has lots of possibilities to typeset poetry (up to very
 complex figurative poems).
 \SpecialChar LyX
 can only support a few of them.
 One is poemtitle, which is a centered title for poems, which will also
 be added to the table of contents (verse is the standard environment for
 poems.
 Memoir has some enhanced versions of verse, but you need to use \SpecialChar TeX
 code,
 because they have to be nested inside regular verse environments, which
 is not possible with \SpecialChar LyX
).

\begin_layout Description
Poemtitle*: Same as poemtitle, but it adds no entry to the table of contents.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX

 However, v3.1 is basically obsolete, as it works with \SpecialChar LaTeX

 That means that it doesn't interact very well with \SpecialChar LyX
, which requires \SpecialChar LaTeX2e
, although
 it has been kludged to work.
 Since Rev\SpecialChar TeX

 with the

\begin_layout Subsection
Installation
\end_layout

 The package can be found at The Rev\SpecialChar TeX
 4 Web Site 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Install it somewhere that \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can see it.
 Test it by trying to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 a short Rev\SpecialChar TeX
 4 document in some random directory (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

not the directory where you installed the class file.) Then, if you reconfigure
 \SpecialChar LyX
, it will find the class file and let you use the Rev\SpecialChar TeX
4 textclass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Probably the easiest way to get started is either to import a Rev\SpecialChar TeX

 The \SpecialChar LyX
 equivalent is that there is a separate Thanks layout.
 Do

Drawbacks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted -712698321 1501168252
The main problem with this layout is that you can't use the optional arguments
 to layouts like Email and Title.
 (The problem is not unique to this layout; you can't use optional arguments
 to the Section layouts either.) This means that after you export that file
 to \SpecialChar LaTeX
 (which you'll need to do eventually to send it in to APS), you'll need
 to edit the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file with a text editor to add the optional arguments to set,
 e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the running title for the page headers.
 Lacking these layouts makes the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaffiliation
\family default
 (and the equivalent 
\family typewriter

\backslash
altaddress
\family default
) useless, so the corresponding layouts don't exist, and will have to be
 added by hand.

 in the

 This is also what's used in the output.
 Think of this as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

visual cue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to remind you that this is a slide.
 Your final slides will use a larger font; ergo, you'll have less space.
 Of course, the larger default screen font isn't WYSIWYG, only a reminder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next thing that becomes obvious is the changes to the paragraph environment
 pull-down box [at the far-left end of the toolbar].
 Most of the paragraph environments you're used to seeing are missing.
 There are also five new ones.
 That's because the 
\family sans

These five are kind of quirky, due to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 You see, \SpecialChar LyX
 doesn't permit you to nest any other paragraph environment into
 an empty environment.
 Now, that's fine and dandy, but it means that you wouldn't be able to start
 a slide with anything except plain text.
 To deal with this, I've performed a little 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

A common feature of all five environments, 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
, is a rather long-ish label.
 The text following this label — ordinarily the contents of the paragraph
 environment — is utterly irrelevant for 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans

 \SpecialChar LyX
 completely ignores it.
 In fact, you can leave these five environments completely empty.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While you don't 
\emph on
have
\emph default
 to put any text after the rather long-ish label, you might want to.
 This could be a short description of the contents of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, for example.
 In that case, enter your descriptive comment and hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 as you normally would.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, on the other hand, you don't want to enter any descriptive text, you'll
 hit another \SpecialChar LyX
 quirk.
 \SpecialChar LyX
, like nature, abhors a vacuum, and will not let you start a new paragraph
 environment until you put something in the old one.
 So, do this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Start entering the text that will 
\emph on
follow
\emph default
 the new 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, 
\family sans
Note
\family default
, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 or 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Now move to the beginning of that paragraph.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Next, hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Finally, change this new, empty paragraph to a 
\family sans

\family default

\family sans

\family sans

\family sans

If you're expecting this section to teach you how to actually make a presentatio

 Naturally, I'll describe all of the ways the 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class can assist you in preparing the materials for a presentation.
 Filling in the contents, however, is up to you.
 [Then again, that

] tells \SpecialChar LyX
 to begin a new slide [duh].
 The label for this environment/
\begin_inset Quotes erd

pseudo-command
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in cool blue, followed by the label, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewSlide:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Any text or paragraph environments that follow this one go on the new slide.
 It's that simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Slides are probably the only time you'll need to forcibly end pages in \SpecialChar LyX

 (this can be specified in the 
\family sans
Paragraph Layout
\family default
 dialog).
 In fact, you'll want to, once you finish entering the contents of one slide.
 If you've entered more text than can physically fit on a slide, the extra
 overflows onto a new slide.
 I don't recommend doing this, however, since the overflow slide won't have
 any page number on it.
 Furthermore, it may interfere with any 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 you've made to accompany the oversized 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 environments work the same way as the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 environment.
 They both create an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 followed by a label [
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewOverlay:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

NewNote:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, respectively].
 The color is a stunning magenta instead of blue, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will look different, in style and in length.
 The label fonts of all three also differ from one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As with a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, if the contents of a 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 exceed the physical size of a slide or sheet of paper, the extra will overflow
 onto a new sheet.
 Again, you should avoid this.
 It defeats the whole purpose of 
\family sans
Note
\family default
s and 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 with 
\family sans
Slide
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea behind an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 is a slide that sits atop another slide.
 Perhaps you wish to discuss a figure on the main 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 before displaying the text associated with it.
 One way to accomplish this is tape a flap of dark paper over the part of
 the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 you want to display later.
 This method fails, however, if you wish to overlap one graph with another,
 for example.
 You would then have to fumble while speaking to align the two separate,
 overlapping 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
s to align the two graphs.
 The use of an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 environment in both cases makes life much easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 receives the page number of its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family sans

\begin_inset space ~

appended to the page number of the parent 
\family sans

\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Clearly, you want the contents of both the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 and the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 to each fit on a single physical slide! You should probably consider an
 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

part of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 Indeed, the \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class provides a visual cue for this: the label at the start of an 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 is shorter than that at the start of a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 Lastly, when you generate printable output, you'll find alignment markers
 in all four corners of both the 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
 page and its parent 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
 These will assist you in lining up the two physical slides.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The major problem in overlaying two slides is aligning the contents of the
 two transparencies.
 How much space should you leave for that graph on the second slide? Worse
 still, what if you want a graph and a sentence on second slide, but there
 is text on the main transparency that goes in between them? You could try
 and insert vertical space of the right size.
 The better way is to use 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As their names imply, 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 are two command-like paragraph environments that make all subsequent text
 invisible and visible, respectively.
 Note from section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:slideQuirk"

\end_inset

 that you don't place anything 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 these two environments, however.
 When you create an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
, it inserts a centered, sky-blue label into the page reading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<Invisible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 For paragraphs following this label, the parts of the 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 [or 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
; it doesn't matter which] where they would be contain instead blank space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
, the corresponding centered label is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

<Visible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in blazing green.
 Paragraphs following this label behave normally.
 Note that the beginning of a new 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
, 
\family sans
Overlay
\family default
, or 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 automatically shuts off an 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
.
 It's therefore not necessary to use 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 at the end of a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By now, it should be obvious how to create overlay transparencies using
 the proper combination of 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 and 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 on a 
\family sans
Slide
\family default
 and 
\family sans

\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Before each figure or paragraph that will appear only on the 
\family sans

\family default

\family sans

 If necessary, insert a 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 environment after the 
\family sans

\family default
-only text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Enumerate
Within the

Overlay
\family default
, change all of the 
\family sans
InvisibleText
\family default
 lines to 
\family sans
VisibleText
\family default
 and vice-versa.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's it.
 You've just made an 
\family sans

\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's one problem with the way I've designed the \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans
slides
\family default
 class: you can't make text in the middle of a paragraph invisible, nor
 make text in the middle of an invisible paragraph visible again.
 To accomplish this feat, you'll need to use some inlined \SpecialChar LaTeX
 codes.

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of a 
\family sans
Note
\family default
 is obvious: it contains anything additional you might want to say about
 a

 It could also be used as a sheet of reminders for a particular 
\family sans

\family default

 In the case of the latter, you might want to make use of time markers.
 Currently, the \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

native
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 support for time markers, a

 So, you'll have to resort to using the \SpecialChar LaTeX

To use time markers, you'll need to specify the extra class option

\end_inset

 [see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

].
 This option turns on timing marks, which will appear in the lower-left-hand
 corner of every 
\family sans
Note
\family default

 To set what appears in the time marker, you use the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 The arguments of both commands are time measured in seconds.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

settime{}
\family default

 sets the time marker to a given time.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 increments the time marker by the specified amount.
 Using time markers and

There's one last feature to describe.

 What's a person to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Luckily, there are two \SpecialChar LaTeX

 out.
 Both must be placed into the preamble of your document.
 The command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlyslides{
\backslash

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will cause the output to contain only the 
\family sans

\family default
s and 
\family sans

\family default
s.
 Correspondingly, the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
onlynotes{
\backslash

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 prevents the output of anything but 
\family sans

\family default
s.
 I'd advise placing both commands in the preamble and initially comment
 both out.
 You can then preview your entire presentation as you write.
 When you're done writing, you can then uncomment one of the two to select
 what you want to print.
 I like to uncomment

Well, what is a syntax checker doing in \SpecialChar LyX
 which is supposed to produce correct
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 anyways? The answer is simple: Just as 
\family typewriter
Lint
\family default
 not only checks the 
\emph on
syntax
\emph default
 of C programs, but also does 
\emph on
semantic
\emph default
 checks for type-errors, 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 catches some common 
\emph on
typographic
\emph default
 errors, in addition to the syntactical ones.
 Specifically, 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 is capable of detecting several common errors, such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Ellipsis detection:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Use \SpecialChar ldots
 instead of ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
No space in front of/after parenthesis:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

( wrong spacing )
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforcement of normal space after common abbreviations:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

is too wide spacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enforcement of end-of-sentence space when the last sentence ends with a
 capital letter:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This is a TEST.
 And this is wrong spacing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Space in front of labels and similar commands:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The label should stick right up to the text to avoid falling to a wrong
 page.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The label is separated too much.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Space in front of references, instead of hard spaces:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If you have bad luck, the text will break right between the referenced text
 and reference number, and that's a pity.

\begin_layout Subsection
How to use it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have the program installed, usage is as simple as choosing 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar menuseparator
Check
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

TeX
\family default
.
 This will make \SpecialChar LyX
 generate a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file of your document, start 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 to check it, and then make \SpecialChar LyX
 insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

error boxes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with the warnings from 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
, if there were any.
 The warnings will be placed close to the point of the mistake, and you
 can quickly find them by using the 
\family sans
Navigate\SpecialChar menuseparator
Error
\family default
 menu item, or the shortcut key 
\family sans
C-g
\family default
 from the default 
\family typewriter
cua
\family default
 bind file.
 Open the error boxes by clicking on them with the mouse, or use the shortcut
 key 
\family sans
C-i
\family default
 from 
\family typewriter
cua
\family default
 bindings, or the corresponding 
\family sans
C-o
\family default
 for the alternate 
\family typewriter
emacs
\family default
 bind file.
 Read the warning and correct the mistake, if it is a mistake.
 If you have trouble understanding what the warning is about, you can safely
 ignore it.
 Remember that there is a hidden layer between the document on screen and
 the technical details in invoking 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
, and this gap can make some warnings seem arcane or just plain silly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is an excellent testing bed for the feature, and it should
 provide quite a few warnings for you to fiddle with.
 Since computers are only so smart, expect most of the warnings to be false
 alarms, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How to fine tune it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, you'll find that 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 makes more noise than suits your mood.
 Then you can choose not to use it, wait until your mood changes, or try
 to customize 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 to get better along with you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 very configurable and extensible, you should not expect to solve all problems
 with 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 in \SpecialChar LyX
 this way.
 Since \SpecialChar LyX
 has to generate a somewhat special \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file to be able to match the
 line numbers from the 
\family sans

\end_layout

\end_inset

 to the internal document structure, some of the warnings will not appear
 correctly.

, or the global 
\family sans
Chk\SpecialChar TeX

\family default
 installation configuration file (usually with the file 
\family typewriter

\family default
).
 See below to learn what warnings can be enabled and disabled on the command
 line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Export your document as a raw \SpecialChar LaTeX

\family sans
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
Export\SpecialChar menuseparator
\SpecialChar LaTeX

\family default
 and run 
\family typewriter
chktex
\family default
 manually on that.
 Invoked in this way, it can be a hassle to find the corresponding place
 in the document inside \SpecialChar LyX
, but with a little patience, you should be able
 to do it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here follows the warning messages that can be enabled and disabled in 
\family sans
Preferences
\family default
.
 Use 
\family typewriter
-n#
\family default
 to disable a warning, and 
\family typewriter
-w#
\family default
 to enable a warning.
 The emphasized entries are disabled by default, because the default is
 "

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that you should only use the options that enable and disable warnings,
 because \SpecialChar LyX
 relies on some of the other command line parameters to be set
 in a specific way to have a chance to communicate with

Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 supports some of the most basic RCS/CVS/SVN/GIT commands.
 If you need something a bit more sophisticated you will have to do that
 manually in a terminal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also note that CVS support is not as good as subversion support
\change_inserted -712698321 1501253107

 In the case of RCS you should read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rcsintro
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (a man file, read it with 
\family typewriter

 This file describes all the basic features of RCS.
 You should especially notice the comment about a RCS directory, and the
 notion of a master RCS file (the file ending in 
\family typewriter

\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you begin to use the version control features in \SpecialChar LyX
, you should be
 familiar with RCS/CVS/SVN/GIT usage.
 The implementation in \SpecialChar LyX
 assumes a recent version of the GNU RCS or CVS/SVN
 package — no guarantees are made for older versions.
 Most of the log messages are not currently displayed after operations —
 you can check them in the Messages pane if 
\change_inserted -712698321 1501253142
you are 
\change_unchanged
unsure.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are finished editing a file, you check in your changes.

Copy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will create a copy of the current document.
 Since RCS does not support copy operations natively, the version history
 is not preserved, and the copy is added as a new file.
 It requires a clean document without any changes since the last checkin.
 You are asked for a file name and a description of the copy operation.
 After that the copy is created, both locally and in the repository.
 If the parent directories of the copied and original document differ, all
 relative paths of included files of the copy are adjusted (like in 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
Save As
\family default
\SpecialChar ldots
).
 Finally, the copy is loaded instead of the original document.

General CVS usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you start from scratch with CVS you have to create your repository and
 checkout the working copy with external tools.
 If you're using a client-server setup you may need to login before doing
 the first repository checkout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your documents are under revision control and others are using the same
 repository problems arise when different changes to the same document at
 the same location happen.
 Standard CVS repositories don't operate with a file locking mechanism.
 This may be surprising, but conflicts only occur if people disagree on
 the proper content of the same part of a document.
 So, if co-workers are used to communicate regularly, these conflicts occur
 rarely.
 If they don't communicate they have a fundamental problem anyway.
 Nevertheless some people like to work with so called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

reserved checkouts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If they do so the working copy of all files is readonly when checked out
 first and the user starts editing after using a special command to make
 the working copy writable.
 When the changes are checked in the working copy returns to readonly state.
 With \SpecialChar LyX
 one has to edit the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.cvsrc
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file and add the line 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
cvs -r
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to work with reserved checkouts.
 The benefit is the possibility to see who is using a writable copy of some
 document.
 It's not guaranteed only one user makes a copy writable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 tries to guess if you're using reserved or non-reserved checkouts.
 If your working copy is readonly or it is writable and an additional copy
 of your document exists in the CVS/Base sub-directory a reserved otherwise
 a non-reserved checkout is assumed.
 When a reserved checkout is detected you have to use 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Check Out
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to make your working copy writable if it's readonly.
 After doing so the 
\begin_inset Flex Noun
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Check In
\end_layout

 operation is possible and that makes your working copy readonly again after
 transferring your changes to the repository.

Rename
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will rename the current document including the version history.
 It requires a clean document without any changes since the last checkin.
 You are asked for a file name and a description of the rename operation.
 After that the document is renamed, both locally and in the repository.
 If the parent directories of the new and old file names differ, all relative
 paths of included files are adjusted (like in 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
Save As
\family default
\SpecialChar ldots
).
 Finally, the document is reloaded using the new name.

\begin_layout Standard
The file exchange through various revision control systems brings the problem
 of merge conflicts in case two different users try to edit the same (parts

 When such a conflict happens it needs manual resolving and one reasonable

 that only one user is allowed to edit file at the given time.

 The information will be available only when you have the file stored under

\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.4/svn.advanced.props.special.keywords.html
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 In short – you set file keywords property (e.g.
 
\family sans
svn propset svn:keywords 'Rev' file.lyx
\family default
) and then paste keyword \SpecialChar TeX
 code
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This is an easy way how to ensure that \SpecialChar LyX
 won't break the line in the middle
 of keyword tag.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 tag in your document (e.g.
 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501253475

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$Rev$
\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_inserted -712698321 1501253480

\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\change_inserted -712698321 1501253480
$Rev$
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_unchanged
).
 This way svn client will automatically substitute revision number (e.g.
 
\change_deleted -712698321 1501253467

\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$Rev: 59 $
\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\change_inserted -712698321 1501253473
$Rev: 59 $
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\end_inset


\change_unchanged
) after each update and commit.
 There are more problems with this approach.
 Firstly, the '$' character is used in \SpecialChar TeX
 world for math equations, so any
 occurence of math formula 
\begin_inset Formula $Rev$
\end_inset

 become 
\begin_inset Formula $Rev:59$
\end_inset

 in your \SpecialChar LyX
 document.
 Similarly for other keywords like Id, Date, Author, etc.
 Secondly svn output is dependent on your locales, so its very easy that
 svn would produce some problematic strings once Date is used.
 Thirdly you get the whole 'Rev: 59' string in your document instead of
 the plain number.
 Until subversion implements user's custom keywords it will be hard to use
 this approach reliably or let \SpecialChar LyX
 to support it directly.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to installing \SpecialChar LyX
, and having access to a Subversion repository,
 the user will need to install the Subversion client program.
 A Windows installer for the client program is available from 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "CollabNet"
target "http://www.collab.net/nonav/downloads/subversion/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The user may also want to install 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "TortoiseSVN"
target "http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, which integrates Subversion operations into the context (rightclick) menu
 of Windows Explorer.
 Operations done outside \SpecialChar LyX
 will typically be more convenient using the Explorer
 context menu.
 Note that TortoiseSVN is not a replacement for the client program, which
 is what \SpecialChar LyX
 itself will use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Bringing a document under Subversion control
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before a \SpecialChar LyX
 document can be brought under version control in Subversion, its
 parent directory needs to be under version control.
 If the document is being added to a project already in the repository,
 this is accomplished by checking the project out to the directory where
 the new document will be placed.
 If the project itself is not yet under version control (for instance, if
 this document starts a new project), the directory must be imported into
 the repository.
 This is done outside \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Both import and checkout are easily accomplished from the Explorer context
 menu using TortoiseSVN, or alternatively can be done using the command
 line client at a DOS prompt.
 The procedure for importing the project using TortoiseSVN is described
 below, assuming an existing repository and a new project being started
 in 
\family typewriter
C:
\backslash

\family default
.
 For information on using the Subversion client program, run

\begin_layout Standard
One big difference of GIT and the other supported version control systems
 is the distributed nature of GIT: With traditional version control systems
 there is one central server which hosts the repository.
 Users commit their changes to the server, and get updates made by other
 users from it.
 With GIT, users commit to a local repository.
 The local repository can be synchronized with one or more remote repositories
 using the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 GIT commands.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does not interact in any way with remote GIT repositories.
 It works exclusively with the local repository in a very similar way as
 with a central CVS or SVN repository.
 If you use remote GIT repositories you need to do the

One of the typical uses of version control is to inspect the changes between

 While this is useful for plain text files, it is much less useful in the
 case of \SpecialChar LyX

 Hence we provide binding to the Document comparison feature.

This feature is supported for SVN and RCS though due to the more complicated
 versioning scheme of RCS there is a constraint – when addressing the revisions
 in dialog, numbers always point to the last number in RCS revision number,

 '35' in '1.2.35'.
 We don't currently support GIT addressing of revisions, one can just compare
 edited document with its revision X steps backs, where X is addressed as

\begin_layout Quotation
Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source together
 in a fashion suited for reading by human beings.
 In fact, literate programs should be enjoyable reading, even inviting!
 (Sorry Bob, I couldn't resist!) In general, literate programs combine source
 and documentation in a single file.
 Literate programming tools then parse the file to produce either readable
 documentation or compilable source.
 The WEB style of literate programming was created by D.

Generating the code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the build menu option is chosen or the corresponding button in the
 toolbar is pressed, a \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file is generated just like step 1 above.
 Next, \SpecialChar LyX
 invokes the 
\family typewriter
Noweb->Program
\family default
 converter.
 This converter needs to be defined by the user and is not installed by
 default, though the Program format is.
 This converter (like any other converter) will have two parts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The converter program itself.
 This program performs the conversion from the one format to the other (in
 this case, from the Noweb format to the Program pseudo-format).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The error log parser.
 This is a program whose sole purpose is to rewrite error messages in a
 format that \SpecialChar LyX
 understands.
 This makes it possible for \SpecialChar LyX
 to place error boxes in the right places in
 the file buffer.

 program.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The build will normally take place in \SpecialChar LyX
's temporary directory, so the files
 produced by the conversion will be in that directory.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will copy out what it regards as the `main' file, but the 
\family typewriter
Noweb->Program
\family default
 conversion may produce several files, and so most of these would then be
 deleted when \SpecialChar LyX
 was closed.
 This is why we pass in the NOWEB_OUTPUT_DIR environment variable so that
 the build-script chunk can place the generated files in that location.
\end_layout

The last piece of the integration between \SpecialChar LyX

 Generally, the instructions for building your program should be embedded
 in a chunk of its own.
 The noweb-specific 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above uses the notangle command to look for this chunk (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

) and runs its contents through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is also a new function implemented in the \SpecialChar LyX
 server, the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When debugging code with ddd/gdb, it is possible to invoke a text editor
 at the current execution position with a single key stroke.
 The default ddd configuration for that is shift-ctrl-V.
 It happens that you can define the editor command line invocation in ddd
 by accessing the 
\family sans

With this, whenever you are using ddd and find a point in the program that
 you want to edit, you just press shift-ctrl-V (in the ddd window), and
 ddd will forward this information to \SpecialChar LyX
 through the \SpecialChar LyX
 server and then the
 \SpecialChar LyX
 window will show the same file with the cursor at the same position ddd
 was pointing to.
 No more guessing or long scrolling to locate a point in the program back
 from debugging !

It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and
 the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald
 Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances.
 The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came
 out in the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that
 occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong
 that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts.
 Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those
 missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain.
 The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to
 me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest
 shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life.
 Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think
 of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and increduli
ty which utterly submerged my mind.
 Let me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those glimpses
 which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very
 remarkable man, that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge
 with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to do so, had
 I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was
 only withdrawn upon the third of last month.

It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested
 me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to
 read with care the various problems which came before the public.
 And I even attempted, more than once, for my own private satisfaction,
 to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success.
 There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald
 Adair.
 As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of willful
 murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly
 than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the
 death of Sherlock Holmes.
 There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure,
 have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have
 been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation
 and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe.
 All day, as I drove upon my round, I turned over the case in my mind and
 found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate.
 At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will recapitulate the facts
 as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.

The youth moved in the best society–had, so far as was known, no enemies
 and no particular vices.
 He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement
 had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was
 no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it.
 For the rest {sic} the man's life moved in a narrow and conventional circle,
 for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional.
 Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most
 strange and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty
 on the night of March 30, 1894.

Ronald Adair was fond of cards–playing continually, but never for such stakes
 as would hurt him.
 He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs.
 It was shown that, after dinner on the day of his death, he had played
 a rubber of whist at the latter club.
 He had also played there in the afternoon.

\size default
 
\size footnotesize
The evidence of those who had played with him– Mr.
 Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran–showed that the game was whist,
 and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.
 Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more.
 His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way
 affect him.
 He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious
 player, and usually rose a winner.
 It came out in evidence that, in partnership with Colonel Moran, he had
 actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some
 weeks before, from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral.
 So much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest.

On the evening of the crime, he returned from the club exactly at ten.
 His mother and sister were out spending the evening with a relation.
 The servant deposed that she heard him enter the front room on the second
 floor, generally used as his sitting-room.
 She had lit a fire there, and as it smoked she had opened the window.
 No sound was heard from the room until eleven-twenty, the hour of the return
 of Lady Maynooth and her daughter.
 Desiring to say good-night, she attempted to enter her son's room.
 The door was locked on the inside, and no answer could be got to their
 cries and knocking.
 Help was obtained, and the door forced.
 The unfortunate young man was found lying near the table.
 His head had been horribly mutilated by an expanding revolver bullet, but
 no weapon of any sort was to be found in the room.

A minute examination of the circumstances served only to make the case more
 complex.
 In the first place, no reason could be given why the young man should have
 fastened the door upon the inside.
 There was the possibility that the murderer had done this, and had afterwards
 escaped by the window.
 The drop was at least twenty feet, however, and a bed of crocuses in full
 bloom lay beneath.
 Neither the flowers nor the earth showed any sign of having been disturbed,
 nor were there any marks upon the narrow strip of grass which separated
 the house from the road.
 Apparently, therefore, it was the young man himself who had fastened the
 door.
 But how did he come by his death? No one could have climbed up to the window
 without leaving traces.
 Suppose a man had fired through the window, he would indeed be a remarkable
 shot who could with a revolver inflict so deadly a wound.
 Again, Park Lane is a frequented thoroughfare; there is a cab stand within
 a hundred yards of the house.
 No one had heard a shot.

All day I turned these facts over in my mind, endeavouring to hit upon some
 theory which could reconcile them all, and to find that line of least resistanc
e which my poor friend had declared to be the starting-point of every investigat
ion.
 I confess that I made little progress.
 In the evening I strolled across the Park, and found myself about six o'clock
 at the Oxford Street end of Park Lane.
 A group of loafers upon the pavements, all staring up at a particular window,
 directed me to the house which I had come to see.
 A tall, thin man with coloured glasses, whom I strongly suspected of being
 a plain-clothes detective, was pointing out some theory of his own, while
 the others crowded round to listen to what he said.
 I got as near him as I could, but his observations seemed to me to be absurd,
 so I withdrew again in some disgust.
 As I did so I struck against an elderly, deformed man, who had been behind
 me, and I knocked down several books which he was carrying.

427 Park Lane did little to clear up the problem in which I was interested.
 The house was separated from the street by a low wall and railing, the
 whole not more than five feet high.
 It was perfectly easy, therefore, for anyone to get into the garden, but
 the window was entirely inaccessible, since there was no water pipe or
 anything which could help the most active man to climb it.
 More puzzled than ever, I retraced my steps to Kensington.
 I had not been in my study five minutes when the maid entered to say that
 a person desired to see me.
 To my astonishment it was none other than my strange old book collector,
 his sharp, wizened face peering out from a frame of white hair, and his
 precious volumes, a dozen of them at least, wedged under his right arm.

 takes care that the shape will always be preserved, no matter how much
 text is in the paragraph.
 Therefore the paragraph size changes with the amount of contained text.
 This can lead to paragraph sizes exceeding the page margins.
 To demonstrate the size scaling, here is the same example paragraph but
 with twice as much text:

An exception is the shape 
\family sans
CDlabel
\family default
.
 It cannot be scaled because it must fit the size of a CD/DVD.
 Therefore the amount of text that fits into the shape is limited.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\family sans
drop
\family default
 shapes and the 
\family sans
circle
\family default
 shape are fragile, meaning that the calculation of their size can fail,
 depending on the amount of text.
 You will then get the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 error 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Arithmetic overflow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this case one can try to remove or add some text; if nothing works one
 has to use another shape.

For shapes with tips you will maybe see that \SpecialChar LaTeX

 for text in the tips.
 Therefore it is often necessary to add hyphenation points

\family default
) to the corresponding text parts.

\begin_layout Standard
Shapepar paragraphs are either always centered or placed on the page so
 that their left border touches the left page margin.
 You can therefore not use the paragraph dialog to align such paragraphs.
 A solution is to put the paragraph into a minipage or parbox and align
 the box.
 The problem is hereby to find the right width for the box.
 Because if it is too wide and you center the box, the paragraph is not
 centered too because it sticks at the left side of the box.
 So you might have to play a bit with the width until it fits.
 Here are two heart-shaped paragraphs, the first one is not aligned, the
 second one is right-aligned:
