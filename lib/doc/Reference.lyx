Introduction
\layout Section

About this Document
\layout Standard

This is the LyX 
\emph on 
Reference
\emph default 
 
\emph on 
Manual
\emph default 
.
 
\layout Standard

If you've looked at some of the other documentation, you might be expecting
 this section to be identical to all of the other opening sections in the
 other documentation files.
 The Reference Manual isn't like the other documents, and requires a somewhat
 different approach.
\layout Standard

First, this file is big.
 It contains \SpecialChar \ldots{}
well, everything.
 Or, it will, at some point.
 At the moment, though, it's still somewhat incomplete.
\layout Standard

Second, to help you get started with this manual, we recommend that you
 have a look at the example entries.
 We'd also recommend not printing out the entire manual, but only those
 sections you happen to need.
 [This document is still a moving target, after all.]
\layout Standard

Third, the entries in this manual follow a somewhat-modified version of
 the format described in the 
\emph on 
Introduction
\emph default 
 manual.
 Most of these modifications are additions to what's been specified in the
 Style Sheet.
 So, if you intend to add an entry, make sure you read 
\family typewriter 
DocStyle.lyx
\family default 
 thoroughly! [You'll find it in the distribution in the 
\family typewriter 
development
\family default 
 subdirectory.]
\layout Standard

NOTE: this document is, alas, very out of date.
 It is wrong in many places, and omits lots of information about newer versions
 of LyX.
\layout Section

Organization
\layout Standard

Each chapter is grouped around a central theme or topic.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{ch:user-interface}

\end_inset 

 describes the user interface.
 Included are the tool bar, the various popups and which menu items and
 keys they are bound to.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{ch:functions}

\end_inset 

 lists all of the bindable functions.
 You'll need this information if you want to alter the key bindings or create
 your own tool bar.
 Lastly, chapter 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{ch:misc}

\end_inset 

 is the Dreaded Miscellaneous! Basically, anything we couldn't figure out
 where to put ended up here.
\layout Standard

The entries themselves are the subsections of each chapter.
 They are in alphabetical order for ease of access.
 The sections of each chapter have single purpose: to split up the chapter
 into more manageable chunks.
 They simply group the entries by letter, so, for example, there will be
 a section labelled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

A-C,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 another called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

S,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and so on.
\layout Section

A Sample Entry
\layout Standard

This is a sample entry to the Reference Manual.
 It should help readers figure out how to use this manual, and show developers
 how to create entries.
\layout Standard

The first thing to notice it the entry name.
 It's not in any special font.
 Now, according to the Style Sheet, function names should be in 
\family typewriter 
Typewriter
\family default 
 font and the names of popups in 
\family sans 
Sans\SpecialChar ~
Serif
\family default 
.
 If you check the chapters containing entries for the functions and popups,
 you'll see that those entries do indeed use this font convention\SpecialChar \ldots{}
in the
 text itself.
 The names of the entries --- i.\SpecialChar ~
e.\SpecialChar ~
the subsection title --- is in the default
 font.
 Leave the entry titles in the default font.
\layout Subsection

Example #1: Entries
\layout Description

Default\SpecialChar ~
Bindings:
\begin_deeper 
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM


\series bold 
Menu\SpecialChar ~
-
\series default 
 Where in the menus you can find this thing.
 If the menu item just brings up a dialog box, put its name in as a 
\family sans 
\emph on 
Description
\family default 
\emph default 
 list.
 Also put in where on the panel the item in bound.
 Put the names of menus, popup buttons, etc.
 in 
\family sans 
Sans Serif 
\family default 
to make it stand out from any other text.
 Underline the accelerator key, if any.
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

In other words, this is just as described in the Style Sheet.
 
\end_inset 

 Example:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

\end_deeper 
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM


\series bold 
Toolbar\SpecialChar ~
-
\series default 
 Should describe the location on the bar and what the icon looks like.
 Keep it brief.
 Example:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

Fourth button from the left.
\layout Standard

Hand with six fingers.
\end_deeper 
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMM


\series bold 
Keyboard\SpecialChar ~
-
\series default 
 There will be either one or two paragraphs here.
 They should just contain a key sequence, and the name of the binding file.
 Put the name of the binding file in 
\family typewriter 
Typewriter
\family default 
 font, and the key sequence in 
\family sans 
Sans Serif
\family default 
 to make it stand out.
 If no binding file name is present, then that binding is standard in all
 of the binding files.
 Example:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard


\family sans 
C-M-p
\family default 
 in 
\family typewriter 
bindfile.bind
\family default 
.
\layout Standard


\family sans

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

The purpose of this entry is to describe these entries.
 
\layout Standard

Within an entry, the different parts are labelled

 parts of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Default Bindings:

 are subparagraph headings.
 None of these should be numbered.
\layout Standard

In a real entry, this will tell you about the item and what it's for.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

This entry will tell you how to use this item.
\layout Standard

There won't always be one of these.
 In fact, any of the
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 sections of an entry may be missing, especially if it's empty.
 For example, there are only 15 or so toolbar buttons, so most things won't
 have a default toolbar binding.
 Or, the author of an entry may prefer to put some of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

Usage
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

This item puts extra bogosity in your documents by activating the bogofilter
 in BoGoTeX.
 Everyone needs a little bogosity in their writings.
 Otherwise, you risk boring your readers into a deep sleep.
 In fact, some science professors, scoffing at the usefulness of the BoGoTeX
 extensions, have written and even published articles in reputable journals
 that have been known to put readers into a coma! Don't believe me? Try
 reading just about any scientific paper!
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Just select the text to bogosify with the mouse, then use the keyboard bindings,
 toolbar button, or menu item for this function.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

Why, this entire entry is an example! It's totally bogus!

\layout Standard

We all know how much cats 
\emph on 
love
\emph default 
 computers, especially the laps that sit in front of them.
 However, a cat, being feline, must add its opinions to whatever you're
 typing.
 Or, your cat may simply decide to help you finish your work so you can
 get to more important matters, such as brushing and petting.
 The decat function is designed for just such moments.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Select the text to decat while holding down all five mouse buttons, then
 use the keyboard bindings, toolbar button, or menu item for this function.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

A particular black and white cat once added the following:
\layout Quote

sfd4rcxy45bb q43 tfd t43revcx
\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
to a document.
 Run through decat, it became:
\layout Quote

Hey, bozo! Pay attention to me!
\layout Standard

Another frisky kitty named Horatio added: 
\layout Quote

';; msdam m-009243m laasd;mlk 
\layout Standard

to some text.
 Decat changed it to:
\layout Quote

Can I beat up another dog?
\layout Standard

We have some quick, last minute notes for you about this chapter.
\layout Standard

If a particular piece of an entry is missing, it's equivalent to saying,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

There is none.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 For example, if, under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\series bold 
Default Bindings
\series default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 there was no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\series bold 
Menu
\series default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 item, it means there is no menu binding.
 Likewise, the guy who wrote the entry may have decided that the function's
 purpose is self-explanatory.
 So, there'd be no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\series bold 
Purpose
\series default

Purpose:
\layout Standard

To produce accented characters from the ISO-Latin-1 character set.
\layout Standard

All of the commands of the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
accent-xxxxxx

 are of the same type.
 Rather than repeat the same entry 17 times, we'll explain how all of the
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 commands work.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

All of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family typewriter

\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

 commands work like a

\end_inset 

 key.
 They add a particular accent to the next character typed.
 There are two ways to use these commands:
\layout Enumerate

Direct Execution:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
command-execute
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 key to enter the desired 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
accent-*
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 command in the minibuffer.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

[See the entry for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
command-execute
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 if you don't know how to execute LyX commands directly.]
\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Next, type the letter you wish to accent.
\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Dead Keys
\begin_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Bind the desired 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
accent-*
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 command to a keyboard key.
 Typically, you bind the command to the key that looks like the accent.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

For example, you'd bind 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
accent-acute
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to the apostrophe key (the ' ) and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family typewriter 
accent-circumflex
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 key (Shift-6 on a US keyboard).

Editor's Note: I may change this and put an entry to the bind command in
 this manual.
 -jw
\end_inset 


\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Restart LyX if it's already running, so that the new bindings can take effect.
\layout Enumerate

Type the dead-key, followed by the letter you wish to accent.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

Using our earlier example, if you type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

^
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 followed by the letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

e
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, you'll produce the character 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\end_deeper 
\end_deeper

To produce the accent by itself, hit the Space key instead of a character.

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:

To forcibly split the current line without ending the current paragraph.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

This command has several purposes, depending on context.
 Its primary function is to manually end a line without ending the paragraph.
 This should only be done when you need some fine-tuning.
\layout Standard

In math-mode, the 
\family typewriter 
break-line
\family default 
 command automagically turns a one-line equation into a multiline expression,
 inserting the new equation line as well as all alignment delimiters.

Return
\end_deeper 
\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

To terminate the current paragraph.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

This command does slightly different things, depending on context.
 Typically, it ends the current paragraph, breaks the current line, and
 starts a new paragraph in the 
\family sans 
Standard
\family default 
 paragraph environment on the next line.
 It also typically removes all environment nesting.
\layout Standard

If you are in the middle of a paragraph, 
\family typewriter 
break-paragraph
\family default 
 splits it in two.
 If the paragraph is a list item, it creates a new list item in the process.
\layout Standard

If you are at the end of a paragraph, 
\family typewriter 
break-paragraph
\family default 
 starts the new paragraph after the current one.
 If you are at the beginning of a paragraph, the new paragraph starts 
\emph on 
before
\emph default 
 the current one.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
break-paragraph
\family default 
 may start the new paragraph in an environment other than 
\family sans 
Standard
\family default 
, but the behavior is not consistent.
 For example, if you move to the middle of an 
\family sans 
Itemize
\family default 
 list, to the end of one of the items or the beginning of the next item,
 
\family typewriter 
break-paragraph
\family default 
 will not change the paragraph environment.
 It will still mess up the environment nesting, however.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

None.
 Your best bet is to just play with hitting return until you build an intuition
 for how this works.

Purpose:

\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Its usage is very much the same as 
\family typewriter 
break-paragraph
\family default 
, with one important difference.
 The new paragraph 
\emph on 
always
\emph default 
 has the same environment and nesting depth as the old one.

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Insert graphics in the current document.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

This function opens the 
\family sans

\family default

\layout Enumerate

Encapsulated Postscript
\layout Enumerate

Inlined EPS
\layout Standard

You'll get slightly different behavior depending on which type you select.
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

This panel previously had a third option, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family sans 
LaTeX or TeX
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, for inclusion of LaTeX graphics.
 This function is now provided by means of the 
\family sans 
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Include File menu entry.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Placement is the difference in the two options.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
Inlined EPS
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 inserts the graphics within the current line, as if it were a normal character.
 This can have remarkably bizarre results on the line spacing if the imported
 graphics is very tall.
 The other option, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
Encapsulated Postscript
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, breaks the current line on either side of the figure, separating it from
 the text.
\layout Standard

Note that this function merely creates a box for the appropriate graphics.
 You must still choose the file to import.
 For PostScript files, double click on the box, which will initially contain
 only the letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

F
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, to open the 
\family sans

 You can now use the options in the

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Changes the font to an emboldened series or, if the font is already emboldened,
 reverts to the default series.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Rather than repeat the same thing for all 9 font selection functions, we'll
 describe the generic behavior of the font functions here.
 Some of the font commands have a toolbar button, others have a menu selection.
 All of them are in the 
\family sans 
Character Layout
\family default 
 popup.
\layout Standard

All of the font commands do the following to words:
\layout Enumerate

If the cursor is in the middle of a word [between two whitespaces], the
 entire word changes to the new font.
\layout Enumerate

If the cursor is at the beginning or end of a word, the font commands only
 affect any subsequently typed text.
\layout Enumerate

You can also tack text in a different font onto a word.
 Just move the cursor out of the word to shut off the font, otherwise, you'll
 change the whole word into a single font.
\layout Standard

You can also change the font of a block of text by selecting it with the
 mouse [or with the keyboard] and then invoking the font command.
\layout Standard

Eight of the font commands, 
\family typewriter 
font-code
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
font-emph
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
font-roman
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
font-sans
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
font-size
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
font-smallcaps
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
font-underline
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
, are toggles.
 They will remove a font if text is already in it and deactivate a font
 if it's active.
\layout Standard

LyX automatically uses the font of the word next to the cursor.
 If the cursor is in the middle of a word, it uses the font of the text
 to the right of the cursor.
\layout Standard

One last thing: we've provided this function because LaTeX has a bold font
 series.
 We know that many users are used to using boldface for emphasis, and you
 can make this the default emphasized font by putting the correct command
 in the LaTeX preamble.
 However, we suggest that you use 
\family typewriter 
font-emph
\family default 
 to emphasize any text and only use 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
 when appropriate.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

For example, to make reference to a vector in the body of the text, many
 mathematician use a bold series.
\end_inset 


\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

This is an example of a bold font series:
\layout Quotation


\series bold 
This is bold text.
\layout Standard

Suppose you have this sentence:
\layout Quotation

Here is some text.
\layout Standard

If you put the cursor in the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

some
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and invoke 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
, you get:
\layout Quotation

Here is 
\series bold 
some
\series default 
 text.
\layout Standard

If you take the first example, select the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

This is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and invoke 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
, you get:
\layout Quotation


\series medium 
This is 
\series bold 
bold text.
\layout Standard

Now put the cursor at the end of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

text.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 Delete the period, invoke 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
, and type in some text.
 You'll get:
\layout Quotation

This is 
\series bold 
bold text
\series medium 
 and this is not.
\layout Standard

If you take the sentence, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Here is some text,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 put the cursor before the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

text
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, invoke 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
, and type in some text, you'll get:
\layout Quotation

Here is some 
\series bold 
newly added 
\series default 
text.
\layout Standard

Now put the cursor after the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

d
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

added
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

 funky 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 [it's important that you type the spaces, too].
 You'll get:
\layout Quotation

Here is some 
\series bold 
newly added funky 
\series default 
text.
\layout Standard

Lastly, we'll demonstrate mixed fonts.
 Again, start with the sentence, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Here is some text.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 We can do the following:
\layout Quotation

Here is some
\series bold 
thing
\series default 
 
\series bold 
bold
\series default 
text.
\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
by 1) placing the cursor after the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

e
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

some
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

; 2) invoking 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
; 3) typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

; 4) placing the cursor before the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

t
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

text
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

; 5) invoking 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
; 6) typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

bold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

; and 7) moving the cursor out of the word.
 
\layout Standard

The last step automatically shuts off the bold font.
 LyX automatically uses the font of the current word [the word next to the
 cursor].
 If you had not moved the cursor, but instead tried to turn off bold font
 by invoking 
\family typewriter 
font-bold
\family default 
 again,
\layout Quotation

Here is some
\series bold 
thing
\series default 
 
\series bold 
boldtext
\series default 
.
\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
would have been the result.
 If you'd tried to turn off bold font by invoking 
\family typewriter 
font-default
\family default 
,
\layout Quotation

Here is some
\series bold 
thing
\series default 
 boldtext.
\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
would have been the result.
 Now let's return to:
\layout Quotation

Here is some
\series bold 
thing
\series default 
 
\series bold 
bold
\series default 
text.
\layout Standard

We'll try adding text in the middle of the words.
 Put the cursor between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

e
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

t
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

some
\series bold

\series default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

ly

\end_inset 

, move the cursor between the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

d
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and

\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 This is what you'll get:

Many new users wonder why this isn't called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

font-italic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and why boldface and underlined text don't have their own menu entries
 or toolbar buttons.
 LyX has adopted a convention from LaTeX: specify 
\emph on 
what
\emph default 
 you want to do and let the computer take care of how to do it.
 The italic font shape is the standard way to emphasize text in typesetting.
 LyX [and LaTeX] has also adopted this convention.
 You can, of course, change which font is the emphasized font by making
 the appropriate changes to the LaTeX preamble, although this will only
 affect the final output.
 There are also some interesting things that LaTeX will do to emphasized
 text that LyX can't [yet] display.
 It will still be in the final output.
 For example, LaTeX does certain things for emphasized emphasized text automatic
ally.
 If you used a specific font, you'd need to do the same thing manually,
 using specific font changes.
\layout Standard

In short, the LyX team 
\emph on 
strongly recommends
\emph default 
 that you use 
\family typewriter 
font-emph
\family default 
 to emphasize any text [this includes book titles] and save any specific
 font command for those few special cases where you need to specify exactly
 how the text is typeset.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

Here's an example of emphasized text:
\layout Quotation


\emph on 
Always use 
\family typewriter 
font-emph
\family default 
 instead of specific font names!

\layout Standard

LaTeX describes font sizes in relative values.
 LyX uses the following terms: 
\emph on 
tiny, small
\emph default 
, 
\emph on 
normal
\emph default 
, 
\emph on

\emph default 
, 
\emph on

\emph default 
, 
\emph on

\emph default 
, 
\emph on 
huge
\emph default 
, 
\emph on 
giant
\emph default 
.
 The 
\emph on 
normal
\emph default 
 size can be set to 
\family typewriter 
10pt
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
11pt
\family default 
, or 
\family typewriter 
12pt
\family default 
, with the other sizes set proportionally.
\layout Standard

A lot of the usage for 
\family typewriter 
font-size
\family default

\layout Standard

You should avoid using 
\family typewriter

\family default 
 unless you need to do some fine-tuning.
 
\emph on 
Never
\emph default

The LyX team has provided this function only for compatibility with LaTeX.
 We know that many users are used to underlining text for emphasis or for
 book titles.
 While you might need to do this on a typewriter, LyX is not a typewriter,
 nor should you use it like one.
 Now, you could make this the default emphasized font by putting the correct
 command in the LaTeX preamble.
 However, we suggest that you use 
\family typewriter 
font-emph
\family default 
 to emphasize any text, including book titles, and avoid using 
\family typewriter 
font-underline
\family default 
 at all.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

There is one - and only one - case that we can think of where you might
 need to use 
\family typewriter 
font-underline
\family default 
.
 Suppose you're writing the bibliography of a journal article.
 The journal you're submitting this article to typesets all volume numbers
 in an underlined font, and wishes all submissions to do the same.
 This is perhaps the only time you'd need to use 
\family typewriter 
font-underline
\family default 
.
\end_inset

\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Use the keyboard, menu, or toolbar to insert a footnote.
 A red box appears on the next line.
 If you're in the middle of a line, the line appears to break around the
 box [it doesn't really].
 Anything you enter in the box will be in the footnote.
\layout Standard

To the left of the red box is another, smaller box with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans

\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 written in red on a grey background.
 Click on this box once with the left mouse button to close the footnote.
 A closed footnote looks like the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
foot
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 written as a superscript in red.
\layout Standard

You can also open and close footnotes, as well as other types of notes and
 labels, with the 
\family typewriter 
open-stuff
\family default 
 command.
 See its entry for keybindings.
\layout Standard

One last note: even though footnotes in LyX appear unnumbered, they are.
 LaTeX does the numbering for you, as well as putting the footnote at the
 bottom of the correct page, when it processes your file.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

This
\begin_inset Foot

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Insert a LaTeX

\backslash

 command.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

The LaTeX 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hfill
\family default 
 stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

horizontal fill.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 As the name implies, an 
\emph on 
HFill
\emph default 
 fills in the current line with blank space.
 You can put it at the beginning or end of a line, which will force the
 line against the right or left margin, respectively.
 However, an 
\emph on 
HFill
\emph default 
 is most useful in the middle of a line.
 The example explains it best.
 The 
\emph on 
HFill
\emph default 
 has pushed the text on either side of it to the left and right margins.
\layout Standard

Important Note: by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

margin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 we do 
\emph on 
not
\emph default 
 mean the page margins.
 We mean the environment margin.
 For example, if your document has two columns per page, an 
\emph on 
HFill
\emph default 
 fills in the line to the left and right margin 
\emph on 
of the column
\emph default 
, not the entire page.
 If you're in a table cell, 
\emph on 
HFill
\emph default 
 fills to the cell borders, and so on.
\layout Standard

You should only use 
\family typewriter 
hfill-insert
\family default 
 for fine tuning.
 LyX has better ways to justify and format text.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

An 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hfill
\family default 
 command here 
\hfill 
 has pushed this text apart.

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Insert a manual hyphenation point via the LaTeX 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
-
\family default 
 command.
 
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

While LaTeX is normally able to hyphenate most words, it has problems with
 other words, especially non-English words and technical terms.
 This command allows you to tell LaTeX to hyphenate a single instance of
 a word that LaTeX would otherwise be unable to hyphenate.
\layout Standard

To allow LaTeX to properly hyphenate 
\emph on 
gnomon
\emph default 
, you type it as 
\family typewriter 
gno
\backslash 
-mon
\family default 
, where you insert the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
-
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 by means of the hyphenation command.
 Use this command to do the same in LyX [see the example].
\layout Standard

Note: To tell LaTeX how to hyphenate 
\emph on 
all
\emph default 
 instances of a word in a document, insert a LaTeX 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hyphenation{}
\family default 
 command in the preamble,
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

Edit the preamble from the menu by selecting 
\family sans 
Layout
\family default 
, then 
\family sans 
LaTeX\SpecialChar ~
Preamble
\family default 
 .
\end_inset 

 where the argument is a space-delimited list of the words to be hyphenated,
 with the hyphenation points noted by dashes, as in 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hyphenation{gno-mon gno-mons gno-mon-ly}
\family default 
.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

This is what 
\emph on

\emph default 
 looks like in LyX when hyphenated.

\end_deeper 
\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Add an entry that LaTeX can use to generate an index entry.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

LaTeX has the capability to compile an index based on keywords marked in
 the text.
 Within LyX, this is done using 
\family typewriter 
index-insert
\family default 
 immediately adjacent to the word or phrase to be placed in the index.
 Note that leaving a space in between can occasionally result in the page
 number appearing in the index to be off by one page.
\layout Standard

When using 
\family typewriter 
index-insert
\family default 
 from the minibuffer, an argument can be used to give the text to use in
 the index entry.
 Regardless of how the entry was created in LyX, clicking on the index inset
 gives an editable popup window to allow changes in the entry.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

Here
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{example}

\end_inset 

 is what an index entry looks like.

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Insert a label (and create a character string label key for it) for use
 in a cross-reference to either the current environment entity or the printed
 page number of the label location.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

This command inserts a LaTeX 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
label{key}
\family default 
 command into the document, which contains a case-sensitive alphanumeric
 label 
\family typewriter 
key
\family default 
 that you define.
 This command allows LaTeX to track the current environment and printed
 page number for subsequent
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

Actually, it doesn't need to be a subsequent reference.
 You can reference a label 
\emph on 
before
\emph default 
 it is defined, but you must then run LaTeX multiple times to allow LaTeX
 to resolve these types of references.
\end_inset 

 cross-reference via the 
\family typewriter 
ref-insert
\family default 
 command.
 The current environment is the section, table, figure, equation, enumerated
 item, 
\emph on 
etc
\emph default 
., that the label is within.
 Note that the actual printed label is not displayed until you view or print
 your document; LyX displays instead on the screen the symbolic label, which
 is the character string label that you defined.
 
\layout Standard

Note that you can't define labels for math equations using this command.
 LyX labels equations using a combination of the 
\family typewriter 
math-number
\family default 
 command and the actual LaTeX command 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
label{key}
\family default 
.
 See the User's Guide for more information about labelling and numbering
 equations.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

If the current environment is a section, as it is here at this point, you
 can insert a label with the following result:
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{test label}

\end_inset 

.
 This label can then be referenced, and the result will be the section number
 for this section, as Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{test label}

\end_inset 

.

nt to use.
 Yes, we realize the nomenclature is confusing.
 Unfortunately, we've changed our terminology but not the function names.
\layout Standard

There are more possible arguments than those listed in the keybindings.
 In fact, the possible arguments change depending on what document class
 you're using.
 In any case, there are so many different paragraph environments that we
 couldn't go into detail about each one here.

Activates the 
\family sans 
LaTeX\SpecialChar ~
Preamble 
\family default 
pop-up, which allows you to directly make additions to the LaTeX preamble
 that LyX inserts in the LaTeX version of the document.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

In the LaTeX preamble, you can insert non-standard LaTeX parameter settings
 or LaTeX commands.
 
\layout Standard

Each document has its own preamble.
 LyX currently adds certain commands to the preamble based on settings you've
 chosen from within LyX.
 Some things LyX just can't do yet, but LaTeX can.
 Or, you may want to use some custom LaTeX macros.
 The 
\family sans 
LaTeX Preamble
\family default 
 popup is where to do it.
\layout Paragraph

Example:
\layout Standard

The following is a typical preamble that changes default settings for twocolumn
 mode, creates a simple custom LaTeX command for later use in this document,
 and then reads in some other personal settings and/or macros from an external
 file.
 Remember, if you want your documents to be portable, you need to bundle
 any such external files with the document file(s):

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Activates the 
\family sans 
Quotes
\family default 
 pop-up, which allows you to set the type of quote marks used by LyX.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Self explanatory.
 Different languages use different symbols for the default quotes.
 For example, French uses 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset 

, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Selecting a different type of quote changes the behavior of the 
\family sans 

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
'
\family default 
 keys.
 LyX supports a bunch of different quotes.
 If you need a special one not present, contact
\family typewriter

 and we'll see what we can come up with.

\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

After entering the command, a pop-up for each open and modified buffer appears,
 asking you if you want to save that buffer.
 This only happens if any open documents need saving.
\layout Standard

At this point, one of two things happen.
 If you executed 
\family typewriter

\family default 
 from the keyboard, LyX simply quits.
 If you used 
\family sans 
Quit
\family default 
 from the 
\family sans

 menu, however, LyX asks you if you really want to quit.
\layout Standard

 key sequence.

\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Use the keyboard, menu, or toolbar to insert a marginpar.
 A red box appears on the next line.
 If you're in the middle of a line, the line appears to break around the
 box [it doesn't really].
 Anything you enter in the box will be in the marginpar.
\layout Standard

To the left of the red box is another, smaller box with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
margin
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 written in red on a grey background.
 Click on this box once with the left mouse button to close the marginpar.
 A closed marginpar looks like the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
margin
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 written as a superscript in red with an '!' in the left margin.
\layout Standard

You can also open and close marginpars, as well as other types of notes
 and labels, with the 
\family typewriter 
open-stuff
\family default 
 command.
 See its entry for keybindings.
\layout Standard

One last note: marginpars aren't supported in minipage environments so LyX
 will warn you if you try to.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

This
\begin_inset Marginal

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

To change arbitrarily the size used by math fonts inside a context.
 Provides an interface to the LaTeX math mode font size commands.
\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

Requires one argument.
 Valid arguments are 
\family typewriter

\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
textstyle
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
scriptstyle
\family default 
 and

\layout Standard

As for how to use these arbitrary font sizes, see a good LaTeX book.
 You should use this for fine-tuning only.
 LyX [and LaTeX] will ordinarily set an appropriate font size for you.
 
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

This is the normal size of a fraction inside text 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset 

, and this other 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset 

 is the result of using

 [There's no visible difference between the two inside LyX, but there will
 be a difference once you print.]

\layout Paragraph

Purpose:
\layout Standard

Insert an interword space at which a line break will not be allowed either

Usage:
\layout Standard

The protected space is represented on the screen as a small, magenta, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 symbol, like this \SpecialChar ~

\layout Standard

hard space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fixed space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 because it is not resized like other whitespace.
\layout Standard

Use the protected space for phrases that you don't want broken at the end
 of a line, or to insert more than one word into certain kinds of headings.
 For example, the 
\family sans 
Description
\family default 
 list always treats the first word of the paragraph as an item label and
 boldfaces it.
 If you wanted to use more than one word as an item label, use protected
 space between the words.
\layout Standard


\emph on

\emph default 
 use

 so use them.

This phrase, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

the\SpecialChar ~

 will not be broken at the end of a line.
 And if we had a description list with multi-word labels:

\backslash 
ref(key)
\family default 
 command allows LaTeX to track the specified key and substitute the appropriate
 cross-reference.
 The environment referenced can be a section, table, figure, equation number,
 enumerated item, 
\emph on 
etc
\emph default 
.
 Note that the actual printed label is not displayed until you view or print
 your document; LyX displays instead on the screen the symbolic label, which
 is the character string label key that you defined.
 
\layout Standard

Note that labels defined in math mode don't become visible to the 
\family sans 
Insert\SpecialChar ~
Reference
\family default 
 popup until after you close and reopen the document.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

See 
\family typewriter 
label-ref
\family sans 
 
\family default 
for an example of referencing a section number.
 That same label from that example can also be used to reference the page
 number at that location; for example, the page number of that location
 is Page\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \pageref{test label}

\end_inset 

.

You can find further description of the LaTeX labeling and cross-referencing
 method in the LyX User's Guide or any good LaTeX user's guide.

\layout Paragraph

Usage:
\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 
tex-mode
\family default 
 command is a toggle function.
 When first executed, 
\family typewriter 
tex-mode
\family default 
 begins accepting characters as a LaTeX command rather than text; when 
\family typewriter 
tex-mode
\family sans 
 
\family default 
is executed again this action stops.
 The result must be a valid and appropriate LaTeX command, or an error will
 result when the file is processed with LaTeX.
\layout Paragraph

Examples:
\layout Standard

The characters accepted as a LaTeX command are shown on the screen in red,
 as this example of the LaTeX
