Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Welcome to \SpecialChar LyX
!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual is designed for all of you who have never heard of \SpecialChar LaTeX
, or do not
 know it very well.
 Now, do not panic â€“ you will not need to learn \SpecialChar LaTeX
 to use \SpecialChar LyX
.
 That is, after all, the whole point of \SpecialChar LyX
: to provide an almost-WYSIWYG interface
 to \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 There are some things you will need to learn, however, in order to use
 \SpecialChar LyX
 effectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of you probably found your way to this document because you tried to
 put two spaces after a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or tried to put three blank lines between paragraphs.
 You found out you could not and, in fact, you will find out that most of
 the little tricks you are accustomed to use in word processors will not
 work in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 That is because most word processors you have used before allow you manually
 to enter all spacings, font changes, and so on.
 So you end up not only writing a document but typesetting it, too.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does the typesetting for you, in a consistent fashion, letting you focus
 on the important things, like the content of your writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So read on to learn more about \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Reading this tutorial is definitely worth the time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
What the Tutorial 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 and what it 
\emph on
is not
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we get started with this section, you need to know that this 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 uses the notation outlined in the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 manual.
 If you came to this manual first, please read the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 before you continue with the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that you know which fonts mean what in the documentation, we want to
 talk a bit about what this 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 is for.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting the most out of the Tutorial
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This tutorial consists of examples and exercises.
 To get the most out of this document, you should read through it, typing
 all the little things we are telling you to type and trying out all of
 the exercises to see if you get them right.
 For convenience, you might want to print out the PDF version of this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are familiar with \SpecialChar LaTeX
, you will probably be able to read the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 somewhat faster, since many \SpecialChar LyX
 ideas are just \SpecialChar LaTeX
 ideas in disguise.
 However, \SpecialChar LyX
 has features you will want to learn about.
 Even if you do not feel like reading the rest of the 
\emph on

\emph default
, you should definitely check out Section

Your first \SpecialChar LyX
 document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK\SpecialChar endofsentence
 You are ready to start writing.
 Before you do, there are a few things we need to mention, which will hopefully
 make the Tutorial more instructive and useful.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because there is information we cannot give you in the Tutorial, the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 
\series medium
thing that you need to do is find the
\series default
 other 
\series medium
help files.
 This is very simple:
\series default
 Start up \SpecialChar LyX
, select the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 from the 
\family sans
Help
\family default
 menu.
 You may want to load the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 as well (if you are not reading it within \SpecialChar LyX
 already).
 This way, you can read them while you are writing your own file.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They can also serve as good examples of how to use the many features of
 \SpecialChar LyX
.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Note that once you have got more than one document open, you can use the
 
\family sans
View
\family default
 menu or the document tabs to switch between them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this Tutorial, we are going to assume that you have a fully working version
 of \SpecialChar LyX
, as well as a \SpecialChar LaTeX
-distribution and a PDF-viewer.
 This should be the case on all major Linux- and BSD-distributions, as well
 as on Windows, where this is setup by the \SpecialChar LyX
 installers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have written a file called 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
 to let you practice your \SpecialChar LyX
 skills.
 Imagine that it was typed by someone who did not know about any of \SpecialChar LyX
's great
 features.
 As you learn new \SpecialChar LyX
 functions, we will suggest that you fix those parts of
 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
.
 It also contains `subtle' hints about how to fix things.
\begin_inset Foot

 Access the text in a note by clicking on it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you want to cheat, or check what you have done, there is also a file
 called
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\family typewriter
example_lyxified.lyx
\family default
 which contains the same text written and typeset by a \SpecialChar LyX
 master.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The example files can be found in the 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 directory of \SpecialChar LyX
's installation folder.
 Open the document 
\family typewriter
example_raw.lyx
\family default
 and use 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
Save
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

As
\family default
 to save a copy in your own directory for you to work on.
 As you fix parts of the raw document, check to see how those changes affect
 the output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the way, the 
\family typewriter
examples
\family default
 directory contains lots of other examples files.
 They will show you how to do various fancy things with \SpecialChar LyX
.
 After you have read the Tutorial, or when you are confused about how to
 do something fancy in \SpecialChar LyX
, take a look at these files.

\family default
 or the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simple Operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 can of course do most of the things you are used to doing with a word processor.
 It will word-wrap and indent paragraphs automatically.
 Here is a quick description of how to do some simple actions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Undo \SpecialChar LyX
 has multiple levels of undo, which means you can undo everything you
 have done since your current editing session started, by selecting 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Undo
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "undo"
\end_inset

) over and over again.
 If you undo too much, just select 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Redo
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "redo"
\end_inset

) to get it back.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Currently, undo is limited to 100 steps.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Cut/Paste/Copy Use 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Cut
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "cut"
\end_inset

), 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Copy
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "copy"
\end_inset

), and 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar menuseparator
Paste
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "paste"
\end_inset

) to cut, copy, and paste.
 Or automatically paste selected text (including selections from other programs)
 with the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Close the window when you are done or leave it open if you find it more
 convenient.
 Most dialog boxes in \SpecialChar LyX
 can operate like this.
 Just be sure you have the right window in focus when you are trying to
 type in the main \SpecialChar LyX
 window or a \SpecialChar LyX
 dialog.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If you like, you can specify whether to make the search case-sensitive,
 or to search for only complete words; you can also search backwards through
 the document.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Toolbar Other buttons on the toolbar allow you to do some of the more popular
 functions, such as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, you have not yet written enough to make most of these functions
 useful.
 As you write more, though, try undoing, pasting, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
WYSIWYM: Whitespace in \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the hardest things for new users to get used to is the way that \SpecialChar LyX

 handles whitespace.
 As many times as you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, you will only get one blank line.
 As many times as you hit 
\family sans
Space
\family default
, you will only get one space.
 On a blank line, \SpecialChar LyX
 will not let you type even one space.
 The 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 key will not move you forward one tab stop; in fact there 
\emph on
are
\emph default
 no tab stops! There is no ruler at the top of the page to let you set tabs
 or margins, either.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many word processors are based on the WYSIWYG principle: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 \SpecialChar LyX
, on the other hand, is based on the principle that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You 
\emph on
Mean
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 You type what you mean and \SpecialChar LyX
 will take care of typesetting it for you so
 that the output looks nice.
 A 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 grammatically separates paragraphs and a 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 grammatically separates words; so there is no reason to have several of
 them in a row; a 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 has no grammatical function at all â€“ so \SpecialChar LyX
 does not support it.
 Using \SpecialChar LyX
, you will spend more of your time worrying about the 
\emph on
content
\emph default
 of your document and less time worrying about the 
\emph on
format.

\emph default
 See the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 for more information on the WYSIWYM concept.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 does have (many) ways to fine-tune the formatting of your document.
 After all, \SpecialChar LyX
 might not typeset 
\emph on
exactly
\emph default
 what you mean.
 The 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
 has information about all that.
 It includes horizontal fills and vertical space â€” which are more powerful
 and versatile than multiple spaces or blank lines â€” and ways to change
 font sizes, character styles, and paragraph alignments by hand.
 The idea, though, is that you can write your whole document, focusing on
 content, and just worry about that fine-tuning at the end.
 With standard word processors, you will be distracted by document formatting
 throughout the writing process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Environments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different parts of a document have different purposes; we call these parts
 
\emph on
environments
\emph default
.
 Most of a document is made up of regular text.
 Section titles (chapter, subsection, etc.) let the reader know that a new
 topic or subtopic will be discussed.
 Certain types of documents have special environments.
 A journal article will have an abstract and a title.
 A letter will have neither of these, but will probably have an environment
 that gives the writer's address.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Environments are a major part of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 philosophy of \SpecialChar LyX
.
 A given environment may require a certain font style, font size, indenting,
 line spacing, and more.
 This problem is aggravated, because the exact formatting for a given environmen
t may change: one journal may use boldface, 18 point, centered type for
 section titles while another uses italicized, 15 point, left justified
 type; different languages may have different standards for indenting; and
 bibliography formats can vary widely.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 lets you avoid learning all the different formatting styles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 choice box is located on the left end of the toolbar and looks like this:
 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/ToolbarEnvBox.png
	scale 75
	clip

\end_inset

.
 It indicates in which environment you are currently writing.
 While you were writing your first document, it said 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Standard,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is the default environment for text.
 Now you will put a number of environments in your new document so that
 you can see how they work.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
You do not have to

 Alternatively, you can change several paragraphs to a different environment
 by selecting them before picking an environment.

Lists and sublists
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 has several different environments for typesetting lists.
 The various list environments free you from hitting 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 a million times when writing an outline, or from renumbering a whole list
 when you want to add a point in the middle of the list.
 Different types of documents logically require different list environments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A slide presentation might use the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment's bulleted lists to describe different points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An outline would use the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment's numbered lists (and lettered sublists).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A document describing several software packages could use the 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
List environments, unlike headings, do not end when you type 
\family sans

 Instead, \SpecialChar LyX
 assumes you are going on to the next item in the list.
 The above will therefore result in a three-item list.
 If you want more than one paragraph within one list

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar LyX
 will not let you select the first bullet (or the actual number in a numbered

 it, which you probably do not want to do.
 This is on purpose because the bullet or number depends on the document
 settings or text position, respectively.
\end_layout

\family sans

 For those two environments, each list item is made up of a term, which
 is the item's first word, followed by a definition, which is the rest of
 the paragraph (until you hit

\begin_layout Chapter
Writing Documents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous chapter hopefully allowed you to get used to writing in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 It introduced you to the basic editing operations in \SpecialChar LyX
, as well as the powerful
 method of writing with environments.
 Most people who use \SpecialChar LyX
, though, will want to write documents: papers, articles,
 books, manuals, or letters.
 This chapter is meant to take you from simply writing text with \SpecialChar LyX
 to writing
 a complete document.
 It will introduce you to text classes, which allow you to write different
 sorts of documents.
 It will then describe many of the additions that turn text into a document,
 such as titles, footnotes, cross references, bibliographies, and tables
 of contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Document Classes
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Different sorts of documents should be typeset differently.
 For example, books are generally printed double-sided, while articles are
 single-sided.
 In addition, many documents contain special environments: letters contain
 some environments â€” such as the sender's address and the signature â€” which
 do not make sense in a book or article.
 The \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
for \SpecialChar LaTeX
 users: this is equivalent to the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 document class
\end_layout

\end_inset

 takes care of these large scale differences between different sorts of
 documents.
 This Tutorial, for example, was written in the 
\family sans
Book
\family default
 document class.
 Document classes are another major part of the WYSIWYM philosophy; they
 tell \SpecialChar LyX
 how to typeset the document, so you do not need to know how.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Your document is probably being written in the 
\family sans
Article
\family default
 document class.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
That is usually the default document class
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Try changing to other document classes (using the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog) to see how they are typeset differently.
 If you change your document to the 
\family sans
Book
\family default
 document class and look at the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box, you will see that most of the allowed environments are the same.
 However, you can now use the 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 environment.
 If you are ever unsure about which environments you can use in a given
 document class, just consult the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Font sizes, one- or two-column printing, and page headings are just some
 of the ways journals' typesettings differ from one another.
 As the Computer Age continues to mature, journals have begun accepting
 electronic submissions, creating \SpecialChar LaTeX
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

style files
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that authors can submit correctly typeset articles.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 is set up to support this as well.
 For example, \SpecialChar LyX
 supports typesetting (and extra environments) for the American
 Mathematics Society journals using the 
\family sans
Article

\begin_layout Section
Templates: Writing a Letter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One way to write a letter would be to open a new file, and choose a 
\family sans
Letter
\family default
 class in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
 While this is the most obvious way to write a letter, it seems like extra
 work.
 Every time you write a business letter, you want to have your address,
 the address to which you are sending it, a body, a signature, etc.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 therefore has a 
\emph on
template
\emph default
 for letters, which contains a sample letter; once you have a template,
 you can just replace a couple of parts of the letter with your text each
 time you write a letter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open a new file with 
\family sans
File\SpecialChar menuseparator
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

from
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Template
\family default
.
 Select 
\family typewriter
letter.lyx
\family default
 as the template.
 Save and print the file to see how the various environments are typeset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you look at the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box, you will see several environments, like the 
\family sans
My
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 environment, that do not exist in most other document classes.
 Others, like 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, are familiar.
 You can play around for a while to figure out how the various environments
 work.
 You will notice for example that the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 environment has the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Signature:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in red before the actual text of the signature.
 This word does not show up in the actual letter, as you will see if you
 view/export the file.
 It is just there to let you know where the signature goes.
 Also, note that it does not matter where in the file the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 line is placed.
 Remember, \SpecialChar LyX
 is WYSIWYM; you can put the 
\family sans
Signature
\family default
 environment anywhere you want, but \SpecialChar LyX
 knows that in the printout, the signature
 should be at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A template is just a regular \SpecialChar LyX
 file.
 This means you can fill in your address and signature and save the file
 as a new template.
 From now on, any time you want to write a letter, you can use the new template
 to save time.
 We do not have to suggest an actual 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exercise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here; just write a letter to someone!
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One warning, if you are writing from a template.
 If you erase all of the text in an environment â€” for example, if you erase
 the whole 
\family sans
My
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 field so that you can replace it with your own â€” and then you move the
 cursor without writing any text, the environment may disappear.
 This is because most environments cannot exist without any text in them.
 Just reselect the environment from the 
\family sans
Environment
\family default
 box to get it back.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Templates can be a huge time-saver, and we urge you to use them whenever
 possible.
 In addition, they can help a person learn how to use some of the fancier
 document classes.
 Finally, they may be useful for a person who is configuring \SpecialChar LyX
 for a bunch
 of less computer-aware users.
 When they are first learning \SpecialChar LyX
, it will be less intimidating if they have
 a letter template customized for their company, for example.

Using Math
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LaTeX
 is used by many scientists because it outputs great looking equations,
 avoiding the control characters used by word processors and their equation
 editors.
 Many of these scientists are frustrated, however, because writing equations
 in \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is more like programming than writing.
 Happily, \SpecialChar LyX
 has WYSIWYM support for equations.
 If you are used to \SpecialChar LaTeX
, you will find that all of the usual \SpecialChar LaTeX
 math commands
 can be typed in normally, but they will show up in a WYSIWYM fashion.
 If, on the other hand, you have never written in \SpecialChar LaTeX
, then the 
\family sans

Panel
\family default
 will allow you to write professional-looking math quickly and easily.

Somewhere in your \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
I like what Einstein said, E=mc^2, because it is
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

so simple.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, that equation does not look very good in \SpecialChar LyX
 and in the output; there
 is no space between the letters and the equals sign, and you would like
 to write an actual superscript for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That bad typesetting happened because we did not tell \SpecialChar LyX
 that we were writing
 a mathematical expression, so it typeset the equation like regular old
 text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we can create a formula that will be typeset properly.
 Highlight the equation and click the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"

 If nothing is highlighted \SpecialChar LyX
 inserts a little blue square, which is an empty
 math formula.
 The expression appears in blue and the blue square disappears as soon as
 the formula is not empty.
 Now type 
\family sans
Esc
\family default
 to leave the equation.
 The purple markers disappear, leaving the cursor to the right of the expression.
 Now, if you type something, it will be regular text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the output you will notice that the expression was typeset nicely,
 with spaces between the letters and the equals sign, and a superscript
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Letters in math mode are assumed to be variables, and come out in italics.
 Numbers are just numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This math editor is another example of the WYSIWYM philosophy.
 In \SpecialChar LaTeX
, you write a mathematical expression using text and commands like 
\family typewriter

\backslash
sqrt
\family default
; this can be frustrating, because you cannot see what an expression looks
 like until you run the file under \SpecialChar LaTeX
 and you may have to spend time, for
 example, finding missing brackets.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 does not attempt to get the expression to look perfect (WYSIWYG), but
 it gives you an extremely good idea of what the expression will look like.
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 then takes care of the professional typesetting.

If you are lazy, you can type actual parentheses in math mode, rather than
 using the

Because letters in math mode are considered to be variables, if you type
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in math mode, \SpecialChar LyX
 thinks you are typing the product of the three variables
 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 The three letters will be typeset in italics, when what you really wanted
 was the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sin
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 typeset in Roman.
 In addition, \SpecialChar LyX
 will not put a space between the word

Display mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the expressions we have written so far have been on the same line
 as the text that came before and after them, otherwise known as inline
 expressions.
 This is fine for short, simple expressions, but if you want to write larger
 ones, or if you want your expressions to stand out from the text, you need
 to write them in display mode.
 In addition, only displayed expressions can be labeled and numbered (see
 the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
), and multi-line equations must be in display mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While being in a formula, click on the display button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "math-display"
\end_inset

 in the 
\family sans
Math Toolbar
\family default
.
 This centers the formula and adds a blank line before and after it.
 Now type in an expression and compile your file to see how it looks.
 The display button is actually a toggle; use it now to change a couple
 of your expressions to display mode and back.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Display mode has a couple differences from inline mode:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The default font is larger for a few symbols, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Subscripts and superscripts for limits and sums (but not integrals) are
 written under and over rather than next to the symbols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Text is centered
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other than these differences, though, displayed expressions and inline expressio
ns are very similar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One final note about the way displayed formulas are typeset: be careful
 about whether you are putting your equation into a new paragraph or not.
 If your formula is in the middle of a sentence or paragraph, then do not
 press 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 Doing so will cause the text 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the formula to start a new paragraph.
 That text will be indented or follow a blank line, depending on your document
 paragraph settings, which is probably not what you want.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LyX
 also supports including pictures in any format within documents.
 (You guessed it:

\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info

 tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LyX

\SpecialChar LyX
 is being developed by a team of programmers on five continents.
 Therefore, \SpecialChar LyX
 has better support for non-English languages (such as Dutch,
 German, French, Greek, Czech, Turkish, \SpecialChar ldots
) than many word processors.
 Even the right-to-left languages Arabic, Farsi, and Hebrew and the Asian
 languages Chinese Japanese, and Korean are supported.
 You can write documents in other languages and you can also configure \SpecialChar LyX

 to show its menus and error messages in other languages.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

 about \SpecialChar LaTeX

 However, some of those who begin to use \SpecialChar LyX
 will be familiar with \SpecialChar LaTeX

 If you are such a person, you may be wondering if \SpecialChar LyX
 can really do everything
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can do.
 The short answer is that \SpecialChar LyX
 can do pretty much everything \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can do in one
 form or another, and it definitely simplifies most parts of writing a \SpecialChar LaTeX

 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because this is just a tutorial, we are only going to mention things that

\begin_layout Standard
Anything that you enter in \SpecialChar TeX

TeX
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Code
\family default
 (toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"

).
 This creates a box where everything within it is passed straight to \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a math formula, \SpecialChar TeX
 mode is handled a bit differently.
 \SpecialChar TeX
 mode is entered there by typing a backslash.
 The backslash is not written out, but anything you type afterwards will
 be in red.
 You exit \SpecialChar TeX
 mode by typing 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 or some other non-alphabetic character, like a number, underscore, caret
 or parenthesis.
 Once you exit \SpecialChar TeX
 mode, if \SpecialChar LyX
 knows the \SpecialChar TeX
 command you have typed in, it will
 convert it to WYSIWYM\SpecialChar endofsentence
 So if you type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
gamma
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a formula and then press 
\family sans

\end_inset

 to a blue 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$

.
 This will work for almost all, non-complicated math macros.
 This may be faster than using the 
\family sans

\family default
, and will be especially convenient for experienced \SpecialChar LaTeX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a special case, if you type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
{
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in a formula, the beginning 
\emph on

 ending braces will be inserted in red while the cursor is placed between
 the braces.
 This makes it more convenient to type those commands that take an argument.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 cannot do absolutely everything that \SpecialChar LaTeX

, while having all the
 convenient features of \SpecialChar LyX
, like WYSIWYM math, tables, and editing.
 \SpecialChar LyX

 This will call the program 
\family typewriter

 which will create a file foo.lyx from the file foo.tex.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will then open that file.
 If the translation does not work, you can try calling 
\family typewriter

\family default
 from the command line, possibly using fancier options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even when the translation does work, 
\family typewriter
tex2lyx
\family default
 may not translate everything, though it does handle most legal \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 It will leave things it does not understand in \SpecialChar TeX

 a file with 
\family typewriter
tex2lyx
\family default
, you can look for the red text and manually edit it to get it right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\family default
 has its own documentation (manpage), which Unix/Linux users can access
 via the console command 
\family typewriter

tex2lyx
\family default
.
 The manpage describes which \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands and environments are not supported,
 what bugs you might run into (and how to get around them), and how to use
 the various options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to understand that 
\family typewriter
tex2lyx
\family default
 can only translate files whose document class is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

known
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to \SpecialChar LyX
, that is, for which there is a corresponding \SpecialChar LyX
 
\family sans
layout file
\family default
.
 If there is no layout file, then you will get an error saying that the
 conversion could not be performed.
 So, unless you have a layout for the document class of your \SpecialChar LaTeX
 file, 
\family typewriter
tex2lyx
\family default
 simply will not know how to translate the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 that it finds there into things
 \SpecialChar LyX
