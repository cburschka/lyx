\begin_layout Section
The Philosophy of \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is \SpecialChar LyX
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 is a document preparation system.
 It excels at letting you create complex technical and scientific articles
 with mathematics, cross-references, bibliographies, indexes, etc.
 It is very good for working with documents of any length in which the usual
 processing abilities are required: automatic sectioning and pagination,
 spell checking and so forth.
 It can also be used to write a letter to your mom, though granted, there
 are probably simpler programs available for that.
 It is definitely not the best tool for creating banners, flyers, or advertiseme
nts (we'll explain why later), though with some effort all these can be
 done, too.
 Here are some examples of what it is used for: memos, letters, dissertations
 and theses, lecture notes, seminar notebooks, conference proceedings, software
 documentation, books, articles in refereed scientific journals, scripts
 for plays and movies, business proposals, presentations \SpecialChar ldots

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 is a program that provides a modern approach to writing documents with
 a computer by using a markup language paradigm, an approach that breaks
 with the obsolete tradition of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

typewriter concept
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is designed for authors who want professional output quickly with a
 minimum of effort and without becoming specialists in typesetting.
 The job of typesetting is done mostly by the computer, not the author;
 with \SpecialChar LyX
, the author can concentrate on the contents of his writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of the initial challenge of using \SpecialChar LyX
 comes from the change in thinking
 that you, the user, must make.
 At one time, all we had for creating documents were typewriters, so we
 all learned certain tricks to get around their limitations.
 Underlining, which is little more than overstriking with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

_
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 character, became a way to emphasize text.
 You were forced to figure out column sizes and tab stops, and set them,
 before creating a table.
 The same applied for letters and other right justified text.
 Hyphenation at the end of a line required a careful eye and a lot of foresight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we've all been trained to worry about the little details
 of which character goes where.
 Consequently, almost all word processors have this mentality.
 They still use tab stops for adding whitespace.
 You still need to worry about exactly where on the page something will
 appear.
 Emphasizing text means changing a font, similar to changing the typewriter
 wheel.
 This is the underlying philosophy of a WYSIWYG word processor: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Unfortunately, that paradigm often results in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is All You Get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where \SpecialChar LyX
 differs from an ordinary word processor.
 You don't concern yourself with what character goes where.
 You tell \SpecialChar LyX
 
\emph on
what you're doing
\emph default
 and \SpecialChar LyX
 takes care of the rest, following a set of rules called a 
\emph on
style
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To be fair, most recent versions of the most popular office suites now have
 some sort of style sheets which follow a similar markup method.
 However, our experience is that they are still rarely used in practice.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Let's look at a little example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you are writing a report.
 To begin your report, you want a section called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction\SpecialChar endofsentence

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So, you go into whatever menu it is in your word processor that changes
 font sizes and decide on a new font size.
 Then you turn on bold face.
 Then you type, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Introduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, if you later decide that this section belongs someplace else
 in the document or if you insert a new section before it, you need to change
 the numbering for this and all following sections, as well as any entry
 in the table of contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In \SpecialChar LyX
, you go to the pull-down on the far left of the button bar and select
 
\family sans
Section
\family default
, and type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, that's all.
 If you cut and paste the section, it will automatically be renumbered â€”
 everywhere.
 And if you enter references to that section correctly (by inserting cross-refer
ence tags), \SpecialChar LyX
 will automatically update them all throughout the file so that
 you never, ever type a section number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let's look at the problem of consistency.
 Five days later, you reopen your report and start Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

4.
 However, you forget that you were using 18
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt bold instead of 16
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt, so you type in the heading for Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

4 in a different font from the one you used for Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1.
 That problem doesn't even exist in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 The computer takes care of all that silly bookkeeping about which thing
 has what size font, not you.
 After all, that's what a computer is good at.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another example.
 Suppose you're making a list.
 In other word processors, a list is just a bunch of tab stops and newlines.
 You need to figure out where to put the label for each list item, what
 that label should be, how many blank lines to put between each item, and
 so on.
 Under \SpecialChar LyX
, you have only two concerns: what kind of list is this, and what
 do I want to put in it? That is it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the basic idea behind \SpecialChar LyX
 is: specify 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 you're doing, not 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 to do it.
 Instead of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You Get,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the \SpecialChar LyX
 model is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What You See Is What You 
\emph on
Mean
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

WYSIWYM.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It's a powerful idea that greatly simplifies the mechanics of writing documents.
 This is also why \SpecialChar LyX
 isn't so good for creating posters and flyers.
 In this case, you 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 want to specify exactly where everything goes, because there are no functional
 units like paragraphs, sections, etc.
 This doesn't mean \SpecialChar LyX
 is missing some cool function.
 It simply means that it isn't the right tool for the job â€” you don't use
 a screwdriver to drive in nails.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a list of things you won't find in \SpecialChar LyX
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The document ruler
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tab stops
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Extra whitespace (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

hitting 
\family sans
Enter
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 two or more times)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tab stops, along with a ruler showing you the position of things on the
 page, are useless in \SpecialChar LyX
.
 The program worries about where things go on the page, not you.
 Extra whitespace is similar; \SpecialChar LyX
 adds it where necessary, depending on context.
 Not being able to type two blank lines in a row will be annoying at first,
 but it makes more sense once you're thinking in WYSIWYM terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are some things that exist in \SpecialChar LyX
, but aren't used as you might think:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Indenting controls
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Page breaks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Line spacing (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

single spaced, double spaced, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Whitespace, horizontal and vertical
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fonts and font sizes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Typefaces (bold, italic, underline, etc.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although they exist in \SpecialChar LyX
, you generally don't need them.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 will take care of these things for you, depending on what you're doing.
 Different parts of the document are automatically set in a different typeface
 and font size.
 Paragraph indenting is context dependent; different types of paragraphs
 get indented differently.
 Page breaks get handled automatically, as well.
 In general, the space between lines, between words, and between paragraphs
 is variable, set by \SpecialChar LyX
.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are ways to adjust all of these (only some of which require knowledge
 of \SpecialChar LaTeX
), either for a whole document or for a specific location in a document.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, there are a few areas where we believe \SpecialChar LyX
 (and \SpecialChar LaTeX
) surpasses many word
 processors:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hyphenation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lists of any type
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mathematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cross-referencing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Granted, many modern word processors can handle mathematical symbols, tables,
 and hyphenation, and many have moved towards style definitions and the
 WYSIWYM concept.
 However, they've only recently been able to do so, whereas \SpecialChar LyX
 is built upon
 the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 document preparation system.
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 has been around since 1985, and 
\emph on
works
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What is \SpecialChar LaTeX
?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LaTeX
 is a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport in 1985.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The source for the info in this section is 
\emph on
A Guide to \SpecialChar LaTeX2e

\emph default
, by Helmut Kopka and Patrick Daly, which has an entry in the bibliography
 of the 
\emph on
User's Guide
\emph default
\SpecialChar endofsentence

\end_layout

\end_inset

 It was built up from a typesetting language called \SpecialChar TeX
, created by Donald
 Knuth in 1984.
 \SpecialChar TeX
 takes a sequence of typesetting commands, written in a script in an ASCII
 file, and executes them.
 Many of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tricks
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the printing trade were modeled by Knuth as computer algorithms and
 incorporated into \SpecialChar TeX
, hence its excellent printed appearance.
 What comes directly out of \SpecialChar TeX
 is the portable document format 
\emph on
pdf
\emph default
 or the so-called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

device independent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 format file 
\emph on
dvi
\emph default
.
 The dvi format is often used for previews and can later be converted to
 other formats like PostScript.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar TeX
 isn't only a typesetting engine; it also allows you to define macros.
 Most people who use \SpecialChar TeX
 are actually using a macro package which Knuth created
 to hide a lot of the typesetting details.
 This is where Leslie Lamport enters our story.
 He wanted a macro package that was more user- and less typesetter-oriented,
 with a set of commands that consistently typeset things like sections,
 tables or math formulas in a uniform, consistent fashion.
 This is how \SpecialChar LaTeX
 was born.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, in parallel with the development and growth of \SpecialChar LaTeX
, other folks were creating
 their own custom macro packages for \SpecialChar TeX
, ones to make slides or articles for
 math journals and so on.
 Some used the raw \SpecialChar TeX
 facilities to do this, others began modifying \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 To try and unify this mess, a team of \SpecialChar LaTeX
-nicians began to work on \SpecialChar LaTeX2e
, the current
 version of \SpecialChar LaTeX
, during the late 1980's.
 This new version of \SpecialChar LaTeX
 has commands which provide an easier-to-use interface
 to \SpecialChar TeX
's macro-creating commands, aid in the use of new fonts, and so on.
 In fact, \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is quite an extensive language in its own right! Users around
 the world have been creating their own add-ons for \SpecialChar LaTeX
 beyond the standard
 ones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to extend \SpecialChar LaTeX
: classes and styles.
 A 
\emph on
class
\emph default
 is a set of \SpecialChar LaTeX
 macros describing a new type of document, like a book, or
 an article.
 There are classes for slides, for physics and math journals\SpecialChar ldots
 many universities
 even have a class for their thesis format.
 A 
\emph on
style
\emph default
 differs from a class in that it doesn't define a new type of document,
 but a different type of 
\emph on
behavior
\emph default
 that any document can use.
 For example, \SpecialChar LyX
 controls page margins and line spacing using two different
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 style-files designed for these purposes.
 There are style-files for a whole slew of things: printing labels or envelopes,
 changing indentation behavior, adding new fonts, manipulating graphics,
 designing fancy page headings, customizing bibliographies, altering the
 location and appearance of footnotes, tables, and figures, customizing
 lists, etc.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section attempts to explain the difference between \SpecialChar LyX
 and a word processor.
 Simply put, \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is the difference.
 By using \SpecialChar LaTeX
 as its backend, \SpecialChar LyX
 helps you to think more about
\emph on
 what
\emph default
 (as in the 
\emph on
words
\emph default
) you write.
 The computer then handles 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 they should look.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Navigating the Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make it easier to answer your questions and describe all of the features
 of \SpecialChar LyX
, the documentation has been split up into several different files.
 Each one has its own purpose, as described below.
 Before you go ploughing into any of those files, however, you should read
 this chapter thoroughly, since it contains a lot of useful information
 and commentary that can save you some time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hopefully, the development of \SpecialChar LyX
 will never stop; so some of the documentation
 may be incomplete or a bit out of date, though we try to keep up-to-date.
 Like the rest of \SpecialChar LyX
, the manuals are the work of a group of volunteers who
 have

\begin_layout Subsection
The Format of the Manuals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of you may have printed out the manuals.
 Others may be reading them within \SpecialChar LyX
.
 There are some differences between the \SpecialChar LyX
-file and the printed version.
 In \SpecialChar LyX
, the title is simply at the top of the document, not formatted on a
 separate page as in some of the printed versions.
 Nor are any of the footnotes or the Table of Contents fully visible.
 To open a footnote, which looks like this: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/footnote.png
	scale 95

\end_inset

, click on it with the left mouse button.
 For the Table of Contents, either click on the grey box or click on the
 
\family sans
Navigate
\family default
 menu, where the contents are displayed automatically\SpecialChar endofsentence

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the printed manuals, all cross-references appear as the actual numbers
 for a chapter, section, subsection, and so on.
 In the \SpecialChar LyX
-file, however, all cross-references appear as light-grey boxes
 like the following: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/reference.png
	scale 95

\end_inset

.
 If you click on such a box with the left mouse button, a dialog box will
 appear containing a list of all the cross-references in the document.
 You can go to the referenced section by right-clicking on the box or by
 clicking the button 
\family sans
Go
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

to
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Label
\family default
 in the opened dialog.
 Going back to where you came from is just as easy.
 Click on 
\family sans
Go
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Back
\family default
 to go back to your earlier location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've cleared up some of the differences between the printed and
 \SpecialChar LyX
-file versions of this file, we can start looking at the format of this
 document.
 You'll occasionally notice things in different fonts:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contributing to \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 is mostly written in C++ (the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 importer is written in Python).
 It is a large project, and as a result it is not free from bugs, or the
 need for improvements in the source code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reporting a bug
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While using \SpecialChar LyX
, you may find behavior which you consider a bug.
 Crashes, though rare, can happen.
 User interface problems are considered major bugs by the \SpecialChar LyX
 team: especially
 helpful are indications of parts of the \SpecialChar LyX
 interface you find confusing,
 or unclear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 has a bug tracking system, which you can find at
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "https://www.lyx.org/trac/wiki/BugTrackerHome"

\end_inset

.
 You should check the bug tracker before reporting any bugs, in case it
 has already been reported.
 If you have a comment on an existing bug, or wish to report a new bug,
 you may either use the bug tracker, or send an e-mail to the development
 mailing list, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org"
type "mailto:"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Archives of this list are linked from the main \SpecialChar LyX
 website, 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://www.lyx.org"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A useful bug report will at a minimum include the version of \SpecialChar LyX
 you are having
 the problem with.
 Accurate, detailed descriptions are preferred â€” the more time developers
 have to spend to pinpoint the source of a bug, the less time they have
 for other improvements.
 Mention the system and system version on which you are running \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Give the versions of the libraries you have installed on your system, and,
 if relevant, the versions of external programs that \SpecialChar LyX
 uses.
 If it's a compilation or configuration problem, include the file 
\family typewriter
config.log
\family default
, and mention which compiler you are using.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Contributing fixes and new features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have made changes to \SpecialChar LyX
's source that you think should become part
 of \SpecialChar LyX
, send your changes as a diff file (in unified format) to the development
 list referenced above, along with a change log, and a description of what
 your patch does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Contributing to the Documentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
's documentation is extensive; however \SpecialChar LyX
 is under constant development, and
 each new release adds new features.
 You may find some documentation needs improvement.
 This section describes what to do if you find an error, or have some suggestion
s for improving the documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reporting Errors in the Manuals

\begin_layout Standard
If you find a problem with the documentation, send a message to the mailing
 list 
\begin_inset CommandInset href

\end_inset

.
 The documentation team will make any necessary fixes.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The \SpecialChar LyX
 Documentation Project, like anything else in the \SpecialChar LyX
 project, can always
 use assistance! If you're interested in contributing to the Documentation
 Project, you need to do the following:

The point of this exercise is to give you ideas.
 The 
\emph on

 are likely to be the most up-to-date of all of the documentation.
 You should be able to glean some insights into how we want the manuals
