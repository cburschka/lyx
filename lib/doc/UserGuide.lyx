\begin_layout Section
What is LyX?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is a document preparation system.
 It is a tool for producing beautiful manuscripts, publishable books, business
 letters and proposals, and even poetry.
 It is unlike most other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word processors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that it uses the paradigm of a markup language as its core
 editing style.
 That means that when you type a section header, you mark it as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bold, 17 pt type, left justified, 5 mm space below
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 LyX takes care of the typesetting for you, so you deal only with concepts,
 not the mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This philosophy is explained in much greater detail in the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 If you haven't read it yet, you need to.
 Yes, we mean now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Introduction
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 describes several things in addition to LyX's philosophy: most importantly,
 the format of all of the manuals.
 If you don't read it, you'll have a bear of a time navigating this manual.
 You might also be better served looking in one of the other manuals instead
 of this one.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How LyX Looks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like most applications, LyX has the familiar menu bar across the top of
 its window.
 Below it is a toolbar with a pulldown box and various buttons.
 There is, of course, a vertical scrollbar and a main work area for editing
 documents.
 Near the bottom of the window is a small window containing a single line
 of text.
 This is the 
\emph on
minibuffer
\emph default
, which really means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

command buffer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Type 
\family sans
M-x
\family default
 when you need to type a command in the minibuffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is no horizontal scroll bar.
 This is not a bug or an oversight, but intentional.
 When you read a book, you expect the end of a line to wrap around to the
 next line.
 Text overflows onto new pages in a vertical fashion, hence the need for
 only a vertical scrollbar.
 There are three cases where you might want a horizontal scrollbar.
 The first case is large figures, displayed WYSIWYG\SpecialChar \@.
 This, however, is due
 to a flaw in the routine that displays graphics on the LyX screen in a
 WYSIWYG fashion; it should rescale the graphics to fit in the window, just
 as you'd need to rescale graphics to fit on a page.
 The second and third cases are tables and equations which are wider than
 the LyX window.
 You can use the arrow keys to scroll horizontally through the table, but
 this doesn't work for equations yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a brief description of all LyX menus and toolbar buttons, have a look
 at Appendix

 Most of them are self-explanatory and you'll find them listed in the correspond
ing sections of this documentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
HELP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The help system consists of the LyX manuals.
 You can read 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of the manuals from inside LyX.
 Just select the manual you want read from the 
\family sans
Help
\family default
 menu.

\begin_layout Section
Basic LyX Setup
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Basic-LyX-Setup"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several features of LyX that can be configured from inside LyX,
 without resorting to configuration files.
 First, LyX is able to inspect your system to see what programs, LaTeX document
 classes and LaTeX packages are available.
 It uses this knowledge to give reasonable defaults to several 
\family sans
Preferences

\end_inset


\family default
 settings.
 Although this configuration has already been done when LyX was installed
 on your system, you might have some items that you installed locally, e.g.
 new LaTeX classes, and which are not seen by LyX.
 To force LyX to re-inspect your system, you should use

\begin_layout Standard
Like most modern word processors, LyX can perform cut and paste operations
 on blocks of text, can move by character, word, or page of text, and can
 delete whole words as well as individual characters.
 The next four sections cover the basic LyX editing features and how to
 access them.
 We'll start with cut and paste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you might expect, the 
\family sans
Edit
\family default
 menu and the standard toolbar has the cut and paste commands, along with
 various other editing features.
 Some of these are special and covered in later sections.
 The basic ones are:

\begin_layout Standard
The first three are self-explanatory.
 One thing to note: whenever you delete a block of text that you've selected,
 it's automatically placed in the clipboard.
 That is, the 
\family sans
Delete

\family sans
Backspace

 keys also functions as the 
\family sans

 command.
 Also, if you've selected text, be careful: If you hit a key, LyX will completel

 You'll have to do an

 You can click there on entries to jump to the corresponding document part.
 In the pull-down box at the top of the outline window, you can choose between
 different lists of document objects, like the list of footnotes.
 Some of them, the list of tables, figures, and algorithms can also be added

 at the bottom of the outline window you can change the position of sections
 in your document.
 So you can for example move section

2.4.
 LyX will then automatically renumber the sections to the new order.

You'll learn more and more keybindings and short-cut keys as you use LyX,
 because most actions will prompt a small message in the status bar at the
 bottom of LyX's main window which describe the name of the action, you've
 just triggered, and any existing keybindings for that action.
 The LyX menus also list the defined keybindings.
 The notation for the keybindings is very similar to the notation used in
 this documentation, so you should not have any problems understanding it.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you do anything else, before you ever start writing a document, you
 need to decide what type of document you want to edit.
 Different types of documents use different types of spacing, headings,
 numbering schemes, and so on.
 Additionally, different documents use different paragraph environments,
 and format the title of your document differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
document class
\emph default
 describes a group of properties common to a particular set of documents.
 By setting the document class, you automatically select these properties,
 making it easier to create the type of document you want.
 If you don't choose a document class, LyX picks one for you by default.
 So, it behooves you to change the class of your document.

Overview

\begin_layout Standard
There are four standard document classes in LyX.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Article for basic articles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Report for basic reports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Book for writing a book
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Letter for US-style letters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also some non-standard classes, which LyX only uses if you have
 installed them.
 Here are some of the classes, the full list with detailed explanations
 can be found in chapter 
\emph on
Special Document Classes
\emph default
 in the 
\emph on

 Society
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
AMS Layouts for articles and books in the style and format used by the American
 Mathematical Society (AMS).
 There are three article layouts available.
 The standard one uses a typical numbering scheme for theorems etc., that
 prepends the section number to the number of the result.
 All result-type statements (propositions, corollaries, and so on) are sequenced
 together, but definitions, examples, and the like have their own sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sequential numbering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scheme does not place the section number with each result, but numbers
 them throughout the article in a single sequence.
 Each type of result gets its own sequence.
 There is also a layout that dispenses with numbering of statements altogether.

 There are several paragraph environments used to create section headings.
 Different document classes allow different types of section headings.
 Only two use the 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 heading; the rest do not and begin instead with the 
\family sans
Section
\family default
 heading.
 Some document classes, such as the ones for letters, don't use any section
 headings.
 In addition to 
\family sans
Chapter

 and 
\family sans
Section
\family default
 headings, there are also 
\family sans
Subsection

\begin_layout Standard
If you change a document class, LyX has to convert

 into the new class.
 That includes the paragraph environments.
 Some paragraph environments are standard; all of the document classes have
 them; but some classes have special paragraph environments.
 If this is the case, and you change the document class, LyX sets the missing
 paragraph environments to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 and places an error box at the beginning of the paragraph.
 Just click on them and you'll get a message dialog that tells you about
 the conversion and why it failed.

Introduction

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before describing all of the various paragraph environments, we'd like to
 say a word or two about paragraph indentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone seems to have their own convention for separating paragraphs.
 Most Americans indent the first line of a paragraph.
 Others don't indent but put extra space between the paragraphs.
 If you choose indentation for paragraphs the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 paragraph of a section, or after a figure, an equation, a table, a list,
 etc., is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 indented.
 Only a paragraph following another paragraph gets indented.
 Note that the indentation behavior is different when you use another document
 language than English.
 LaTeX takes care that the indentation follows the rules of the used language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The space between paragraphs, like the line spacing, the space between headings
 and text --- in fact, all of the spacings for just about everything are
 pre-coded into LyX.
 As we said, you don't worry about how much space to add between what.
 LyX takes care of that.
 In fact, these pre-coded vertical spacings aren't a single number but a
 range.
 That way, LyX can squish or stretch the space between lines to make sure
 figures fit on a page with text, so that sections don't start at the bottom
 of a page, and so on.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX does this when LyX goes to produce a printable file.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, pre-coded doesn't mean you can't change them.
 LyX gives you the ability to globally change 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of these pre-coded spacings.
 We'll explain more later.

command sequence in LaTeX files.
 If you don't know LaTeX, or the concept of a paragraph environment is totally
 alien to you, we urge you to read the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
.
 The 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 also contains many more examples than this section does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A paragraph environment is simply a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

container
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a paragraph which gives that paragraph certain properties.
 This can include a particular style of font, different margins, a numbering
 scheme, labels, and so on.
 Additionally, you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the different environments inside one another, allowing one environment
 to inherit some of the properties of another.
 The different paragraph environments totally replace the need for messy
 tab stops, on the fly margin adjustment, and other hold-overs from the
 days of typewriters.
 There are several paragraph environments which are specific to a particular
 document type.
 We'll only be covering the most common ones here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To choose a new paragraph environment, use the pull-down box 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/ToolbarEnvBox.png
	scale 70
	clip

\end_inset

 at the left end of the toolbar.
 LyX will change the environment of the 
\emph on
entire
\emph default
 paragraph in which the cursor sits.
 You can also change the environment of an entire group of paragraphs if
 you select them before choosing the new environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 will 
\emph on
typically
\emph default
 create a new paragraph using the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 paragraph environment.
 We say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

typically
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because if you are in one of these environments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard
LyX keeps the old paragraph environment when you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, rather than resetting it to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 LyX will still reset the nesting depth, however.
 Usually, starting a new paragraph resets both the paragraph environment
 and the nesting depth (for more on nesting see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Nesting"

\end_inset

).
 At the moment, all this is context-specific; you're better off expecting
 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 to reset the paragraph environment and depth.
 If you want a new paragraph to keep the current environment and depth,
 use 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Standard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default paragraph environment is 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 for most classes.
 It creates a plain paragraph.
 If LyX resets the paragraph environment, this is the one it chooses.
 In fact, the paragraph you're reading right now (and most of the ones in
 this manual) are in the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can nest a paragraph using the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment in just about anything else, but you can't really nest anything
 in a 
\family sans

 For certain types of documents, LaTeX places all of this on a separate

Special Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following information applies to all section headings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot do any nesting with these environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot use a margin note in any of these environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can only use inline math in these environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can use labels and cross-references to refer to their numbers.

\begin_layout Subsection
Quotes and Poetry line spacing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has three paragraph environments for writing poetry and quotations.
 They are 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
.
 Forget the days of changing line spacing and twiddling with margins.
 These three paragraph environments already have those changes built-in.
 They all widen the left margin and add a bit of extra space above and below
 the text they contain.
 They also allow nesting, so you can put a 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 in a 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, as well as in some other paragraph environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another feature of these three paragraph environments: they do
 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 when you start a new paragraph.
 So, you can type in that poem and merrily hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 without worrying about the paragraph environment changing on you.
 Of course, that means that, once you're done typing in that poem, you have
 to change back to the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment yourself.

Now that we've described the similarities of these three environments, it's
 time for the differences.
 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 are identical except for one difference: 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 uses extra spacing to separate paragraphs and never indents the first line.
 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 indents the first line of a paragraph and uses the same line spacing throughout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example of the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This is in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 I can keep writing, extending this line out further and further until it
 wraps.
 See -- no indentation!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Here's the second paragraph of this quote.
 Again, there's no indentation, but there is extra space between me and
 the other paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another example, this time in the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
This is in the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 environment.
 If I keep writing, you'll see the indentation.
 If your country uses a writing style that shows off new paragraphs by indenting
 the first line, then 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 is the environment for you! Well, you'd use it 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 you were quoting other text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Here's a new paragraph.
 I could ramble on and on, like a politician at election time.
 If I did that, though, you'd get bored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the examples show, 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 is for those people who use extra space to separate paragraphs.
 They should put quotes in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 Those who use indentation to mark a new paragraph should use the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 paragraph environment for quoted text.

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has four different paragraph environments for creating different kinds
 of lists.
 In the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments, LyX labels your list items with bullets or numbers, respectively.
 In the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 and 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environments, LyX lets you provide your own label.
 We'll present the individual details of each type of list next after describing
 some general features of all four of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four paragraph environments for lists differ from the other environments
 in several ways.
 First, LyX treats each paragraph as a list item.
 Hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 but keeps the current environment and creates a new list item.
 The nesting depth is hereby kept.
 If you want to keep the paragraph environment but reset the current nesting
 depth, you can use 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 to break paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can nest lists of any type inside one another.
 In fact, LyX changes the labels on some list items depending on how it
 is nested.
 If you intend to use any of the list paragraph environments, we suggest
 you read all of section
\begin_inset space ~

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first type of list we'll describe in detail is the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 paragraph environment.
 It has the following properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each item has a particular bullet or symbol as its label.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
LyX uses the same symbol for all of the items in a given nesting level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The symbol appears at the beginning of the first line.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The items can have any length.
 LyX automatically offsets the left margin of each item.
 The offset is always relative to whatever environment the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list may be in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you nest an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment inside another 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, the label changes to a new symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are four different symbols for up to a four-fold nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX always shows the same symbol on screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
See section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Nesting"

\end_inset

 for a full explanation of nesting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Of course, that explanation was also an example of an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list.
 The 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment is best suited for lists where the order doesn't matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We said that different levels use different symbols as their label.
 Here's an example of all four possible symbols.
 Note that those of you reading this manual within LyX won't see any difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the first level 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 is a large black dot, or bullet.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the second level is a dash.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the third is an asterisk.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the fourth is a centered dot.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back out to the third level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back to the second level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back to the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the default labels for an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list.
 You can customize these labels in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment is used to create numbered lists and outlines.
 It has these properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each item has a numeral as its label.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The type of numeral depends on the nesting depth.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
LyX automatically counts the items for you and updates the label as appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each new 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment resets the counter to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Like the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Offsets the items relative to the left margin.
 Items can have any length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduces the space between items as the nesting depth increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Uses different types of labels depending on the nesting depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allows up to a four-fold nesting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 shows the different labels for each item in LyX.
 Here is how LyX labels the four different levels in an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first level of an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 uses Arabic numerals followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The second level uses lower case letters surrounded by parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The third level uses lower-case Roman numerals followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The fourth level uses capital letters followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Again, notice the decrease in the spacing between items as the nesting depth
 increases.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the third level
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the second level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, you can customize the type of numbering used in the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
 It involves adding commands to the LaTeX preamble (see the 
\emph on
Extended Features
\emph default
 manual).
 As stated earlier, such customization only shows up in the printed version,
 not in LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is more to nesting 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments than we've stated here.
 You should read section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the previous two environments, the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 list has no fixed label.
 Instead, LyX uses the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the first line as the label.
 Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: This is an example of the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX typesets the label in boldface and puts extra space between it and the
 rest of the line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it is meant that the first hit of the 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 key ends the label if you are at the beginning of the first line of an
 item.
 If you need to use more than one word in the label use a 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Usage: You should use the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment for things like definitions and theorems.
 Use it when you need to make one word in particular stand out in the text
 that describes it.
 It's not a good idea to use a 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment when you have an entire sentence that you want to describe.
 You're better off using 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and nesting several 
\family sans

 paragraphs into them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Nesting: You can nest 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment has user-defined labels for each list item.
 There are the following properties of this list environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
item
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

labels LyX uses the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of each line as the item label.
 The first 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 after the beginning of the first line of an item marks the end of the label.
 If you need to use more than one word in an item label, use a protected
 blank as described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
margins As you can see, LyX uses different margins for the item label and
 the body of the item text.
 The body of the text has a larger left margin, which is equal to the default
 label width plus a little extra space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
label
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

width LyX uses the width of the label, or the default width, whatever is
 larger.
 If the label width is larger, the label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the first line.
 In other words, the text of the first line isn't aligned with the left
 margin of the rest of the item text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
default
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

width You can set the default label width to ensure that the text of all
 items in a 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment have the same left margin.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To change the default width, select all items in the list.
 Now open the 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Paragraph
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Settings
\family default
 dialog.
 The text in the box 
\family sans
Longest
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

label
\family default
 determines the default label width.
 You can use the text of your largest label here, but you can also use the
 letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 multiple times instead.
 The M is the widest character and is a standard unit of widths in LaTeX.
 By using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the unit of width you don't need to keep changing the contents of

 Notice that the lines all have the same left margin, which LyX sets to
 fit the largest block of text on a single line.
 Here's an example of the 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Address
Who are you
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Where do I send this
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Your post office and country
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, both 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 add extra space between themselves and the next paragraph.
 If you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 in either of these environments, LyX resets the nesting depth and sets
 the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 This makes sense, since 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 function, and the individual lines of an address are not paragraphs.
 Thus, you have to use 
\family typewriter
break-line
\family default
 (
\family sans
C-Return

 or 
\family sans

Academic Writing

\begin_layout Standard
Most academic writing begins with an abstract and ends with a bibliography
 or list of references.
 LyX contains paragraph environments for both of these.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment is used for the abstract of an article.
 Technically, you could use this environment anywhere, but you really should
 only use it at the beginning of the document, after the title.
 Also, don't bother trying to nest 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 in anything else or vice versa.
 It won't work.
 The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment is only useful in the article and report document classes.
 The book document classes ignores the 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 completely, and it's utterly silly to use 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 in a letter document class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment does several things for you.
 First, it puts the centered label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above the text.
 The label and the text of the abstract are separated by some extra vertical
 space.
 Second, it typesets everything in a smaller font, just as you'd expect.
 Lastly, it adds a bit of extra vertical space between the abstract and
 the subsequent text.
 Well, that's how it will appear on the LyX screen.
 The appearance in the output depends on the used article or report class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting a new paragraph by hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does not reset the paragraph environment.
 The new paragraph will still be in the 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment.
 So, you will have to change the paragraph environment yourself when you
 finish entering the abstract of your document.

The

\family default
 environment is used to list references.
 Technically, you could use this environment anywhere, but you really should
 only use it at the end of the document.
 Nesting 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you first open a 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment, LyX add a large vertical space, followed by the heading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bibliography
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

References,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 depending on the document class.
 The heading is in a large boldface font.
 Each paragraph of the 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment is a bibliography entry.
 Thus, hitting 
\family sans

\family default
 does not reset the paragraph environment.
 Each new paragraph is still in the 
\family sans

 environment.
\end_layout

The

 It also treats the

\end_inset

\end_layout

\end_inset

 this is the only case in which you can type multiple whitespaces in LyX.
 If you need to insert blank lines, you'll still need to use 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
 (the 
\family typewriter
break-line
\family default
 function).
 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 breaks paragraphs.
 Note, however, that 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does not reset the paragraph environment.
 So, when you finish using the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment, you'll need to change the paragraph environment yourself.
 Also, you can nest the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment inside of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few quirks with this environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot use 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
 at the beginning of a new paragraph (i.e.
 you can't follow

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Use a 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 to begin a new paragraph, then you can use a 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Or: use 
\family sans
C-Space
\family default
 instead.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You can't have an empty paragraph or an empty line.
 You must put at least one 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 in any line you want blank.
 Otherwise, LaTeX generates errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot get the typewriter double quotes by typing 
\family sans

\family default
 since that will insert 
\emph on
real

 You get the typewriter double quotes with 
\family sans
C-"
\family default
 (or 
\family sans

 if you use Emacs-like key bindings).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX treats text as a unified block with a particular context and specific
 properties.
 This allows you to create blocks that inherits some of the properties of
 another block.
 For example you have three main points in an outline, but point #2 also
 has two subpoints.
 In other words, you have a list inside of another list, with the inner
 list 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attached
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to item #2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
sublist - item #1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
sublist - item #2
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You put a list inside of a list by nesting one list inside the other.
 Nesting an environment is quite simple: Select 
\family sans
Increase
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

List
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Depth
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Decrease
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

List
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Depth
\family default
 from the 
\family sans
Edit
\family default
 menu to change the nesting depth of the current paragraph (the status bar
 will tell you how far you are nested).
 Instead of the menu, you can also use the toolbar buttons 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/depth-increment.png

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/depth-decrement.png

\end_inset

 or the convenient key bindings 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
 and 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
 to change the nesting level.
 The change will work on the current selection if you have made one (allowing
 you to change the nesting of several paragraphs at once), or the current
 paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that LyX only changes the nesting depth if it can.
 If it's invalid to do so, nothing happens if you try to change the depth.
 Additionally, if you change the depth of one paragraph, it affects the
 depth of every paragraph nested inside of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nesting isn't limited to lists.
 In LyX, you can nest just about anything inside anything else, as you're
 about to find out.
 This is the real power of nesting paragraph environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What You Can and Can't Nest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we fire a list of paragraph environments at you, we need to tell
 you a little bit more about how nesting works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question if nesting a paragraph environment is possible, is a bit more
 complicated than a simple yes or no.
 There are three types of paragraph environments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Completely unnestable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fully nestable, you can nest them inside of things and you can also nest
 other things inside of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A third type, you can nest them into other environments, but you can't nest
 anything into them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a list of the three types of nesting behavior, and which paragraph
 environments have them:

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of levels, LyX can perform up to a six-fold nesting.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

level #6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the innermost possible depth.
 Here's an example to display what we mean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
level #1 - outermost
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #2
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #3
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
level #6
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
There are two exceptions to the six-fold nesting limit, and you can see
 both of them in the example.
 Unlike the other fully-nestable environments, you can only perform a four-fold
 nesting with the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments.
 For example, if we tried to nest another 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 list inside of item 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we'd get errors.

The best way to explain just what you can do with nesting is by illustration.
 We have several examples of nested environments.
 In them, we explain how we created the example, so that you can reproduce
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example 1: The Six-fold Way and Mixed Nesting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#1-a This is the outermost level.
 It's a 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#2-a This is level #2.
 We created it by using 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#3-a This is level #3.
 This time, we just hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, then used 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
 twice in a row.
 We could have also created it the same way as we did the previous level,
 by hitting 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This is actually a 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment, nested inside of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#3-a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, it's at level #4.
 We did this by hitting 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
, then 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
, then changing the paragraph environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 Do this to create list items with more than one paragraph - it also works
 for the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 paragraph, also at level #4, made with just a 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#4-a This is level #4.
 We hit 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 and changed the paragraph environment back to 
\family sans
List
\family default
.
 Remember - we can't nest anything inside of a 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment, which is why we're still at level #4.
 However, we 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 keep nesting things inside of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#3-a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#5-a This is level #5\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#6-a \SpecialChar \ldots{}
and this is level #6.
 By now, you should know how we made these two.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#5-b Back to level #5.
 Just hit 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by a 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#4-b After another 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by a 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
, we're back at level #4.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#3-b Back to level #3.
 By now it should be obvious how we did this.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#2-b Back to level #2.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#1-b And last, back to the outermost level, #1.
 After this sentence, we'll hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 and change the paragraph environment back to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 to end the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could have also used the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, or even the 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 environment in place of the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
 The example would have worked exactly the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example 2: Inheritance
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
This is the LyX-Code environment, at level #1, the outermost
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
level.
  Now we'll hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, then 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
, after which, we'll change to the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment, at level #2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Notice how the nested 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 not only inherits its margins from its parent environment (
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
), but also inherits its font and spacing!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We ended this example by hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 After that, we needed to reset the paragraph environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 and resetting the nesting depth by using 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
 once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #1, in an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 paragraph environment.
 We're actually going to nest a bunch of these.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #2.
 We used 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
.
 Now, what happens if we nest an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment inside of this one? It will be at level #3, but what will its
 label be? An asterisk?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
No! It's a bullet.
 This is the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, even though it's at level #3.
 So, its label is a bullet.
 (We got here by using 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
, then 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
, then changing the environment to 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
.)
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Here's level #4, produced using 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
, then 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\family default
.
 We'll do that again\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
to get to level #5.
 This time, however, we also changed the paragraph environment back to 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
.
 Notice the type of numbering, it is 
\emph on
lowercase Roman
\emph default
, because we are in the 
\emph on
thirdfold
\emph default
 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment (i.e.
 it is an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 inside an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 inside an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What happens if we 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 change the paragraph environment, but decrease the nesting depth? What
 type of numbering does LyX use?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Oh, as if you couldn't guess by now, we're just using 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 to keep the current environment and depth but create a new item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's use 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
 to decrease the depth after the next 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #4.
 Look what type of label LyX is using!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #3.
 Even though we've changed levels, LyX is still using a lowercase Roman
 numeral as the label.Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because, even though the nesting depth has changed, the paragraph is 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 a thirdfold 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
 Notice, however, that LyX 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 reset the counter for the label.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Another 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
 sequence, and we're back to level #2.
 This time, we not only changed the nesting depth, but we also moved back
 into the twofold-nested 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The same thing happens if we do another 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
 sequence and return to level #1, the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we reset the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 As you can see, the level number doesn't correspond to what type of labeling
 LyX uses for the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments.
 The number of other 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments surrounding it determines what kind of label LyX uses for
 an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 item.
 The same rule applies for the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, as well.

\begin_layout Standard
Horizontal fills (HFills) are a special LyX feature for adding extra space
 in a uniform fashion.
 An HFill is actually a variable length space, whose length always equals
 the remaining space between the left and right margins.
 If there is more than one HFill on a line, they divide the available space
 equally between themselves.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't like the way LaTeX does the pagebreaks in your document, you
 can force a pagebreak where you want one.
 Normally this will not be necessary, because LaTeX is good at pagebreaking.
 Only if you use many 
\family sans
Floats
\family default
, LaTeX's page breaking algorithm can fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recommend not to use forced pagebreaks until the text is finished, and
 until you have checked in the preview to see if you 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 have to change the pagebreaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two types of pagebreaks: One that ends the page without any special
 action.
 This can be inserted above or below a paragraph via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Formatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Page
\family default
.
 The second type, that is inserted via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Formatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Break
\family default
, ends a page but stretches the content of the page, so that it fills out
 the complete page.
 This type is useful to avoid whitespace when a pagebreak produces a page
 on which only the last few lines are absent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might try to use a pagebreak to ensure that a figure or table appears
 at the top of a page.
 This is, of course, the wrong way to do it.
 LyX gives you a way of automatically ensuring that your figures and tables
 appear at the top of a page (or the bottom, or on their own page) without
 having to worry about what precedes or follows your figure or table.

\begin_layout Standard
Differently to forced pagebreaks where the content behind the break is directly
 placed at the next page, pages can also be cleared while breaking them.
 That means that the current paragraph is terminated and all, perhaps not
 yet processed floats from previous document parts are placed behind it,
 if necessary by adding pages.
\end_layout

You can insert a clear pagebreak with the menu

 in justified paragraphs due to whitespace introduced by linebreaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You shouldn't use forced linebreaks to correct LaTeX's linebreaking, as
 LaTeX is very good at linebreaking.
 There are, however, a number of situations where it is necessary to actively

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Fonts ! Vector-

\end_inset

 are fonts, built from outlines of the single glyphs (i.e.
 characters) in the font.
 This means that each glyph is defined using mathematical curves that are
 well suited for scaling to any requested size.
 This mathematical definition is interpreted by the font renderer and the
 curve is filled out with pixels according to the size and glyph.
 This means that outline fonts will look pretty good in all sizes.
 Only at very small sizes it might be hard to provide a good rendering at
 very small sizes, where each pixel has to be very carefully computed to
 provide a good image.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

One could mean that one only needs to define one font size and scale them.
 But to achieve a better quality, many fonts define several font sizes.
 That improves the appearance, because you need more details at large font
 sizes than at small ones.

 on the other hand, are defined by bitmap graphics from the start, so they
 will look good at all the sizes they are meant for.
 However, they don't scale well, because in order to scale a glyph, each
 pixel is enlarged into several pixels.
 It is the same effect that happens if you try to enlarge a picture in a
 picture manipulation program.
 In order to relieve this effect, bitmap fonts are typically provided in
 several fixed sizes typically from around 8 pixels high up to 34 pixels
 or so high in steps according to what is believed to be useful.
 The advantage of bitmap fonts is that no complicated computations are necessary
 to display each glyph, so bitmap fonts are thus faster displayed than scalable
 fonts.
 The disadvantage is that sizes that don't exists as fixed versions have
 to be scaled by doubling pixels, and thus look bad.

\begin_layout Standard
The result of all this, is that bitmap fonts are best for the size they
 are designed for, while scalable fonts are good for nearly all sizes.
 So one need less font size definitions for scalable fonts.
 That's the reason why nearly all text render and typesetting programs use
 scalable fonts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test which fonts are used in a PDF-document, you can have a look into
 its document properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many modern typesetting and markup languages have begun to move towards
 specifying character styles rather than specifying a particular font.
 For example, instead of changing to an italicized version of the current
 font to emphasize text, you use an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emphasized style
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead.
 This concept fits in perfectly with LyX.
 In LyX, you do things based on contexts, rather than focusing on typesetting
 details.

LyX uses the program LaTeX as its backend.
 LaTeX is just a macro package for the TeX typesetting system, but to prevent
 confusion, we'll only refer to LaTeX.
 LyX is what you use to do your actual writing.
 Then, LyX calls LaTeX to turn your writing into printable output.
 This happens in two stages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First, LyX converts your document to a series of text commands for LaTeX,
 generating a file with the extension, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 file to produce printable output.

 As LyX allows you to use any known image format in your document, it has
 to convert them in the background to EPS.
 If you have e.g 50 images in your document, LyX has to do 50 conversions
 whenever you view or export your document.
 This will slow down your workflow with LyX drastically.
 So if you plan to use PostScript, you can insert your images directly as
 EPS to avoid this problem.

 You can although use any other image format, because LyX converts them

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes you want to prevent words or constructs to be hyphenated.
 The keybindings/shortcuts in this document consists of three letters with
 a hyphen and a space in the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 LaTeX finds there the hyphen 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

-
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 as hyphenation possibility.
 Hyphenating at this point would look ugly.
 To prevent the shortcut from being hyphenated, we can put it in the argument
 of the LaTeX-box-command 
\series bold

\backslash
mbox
\series default
, because text within LaTeX-boxes can't be hyphenated.
 As LyX doesn't support

\begin_layout Standard
When LyX calls LaTeX to generate the final version of your document, LaTeX
 automatically distinguishes between words, sentences, and abbreviations.
 LaTeX then adds the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appropriate amount of space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 That means sentences get a little bit more space between the period and
 the next word.
 Abbreviations get the same amount of space after the period as a word uses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the algorithm for figuring out what's an abbreviation works
 not for all cases.
 If a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is at the end of a lowercase letter, it's the end of a sentence; if it's
 at the end of a capitalized letter, it's an abbreviation.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And here's an example of the algorithm going wrong:

It is standard typesetting practice to group certain letters together and

\begin_layout Standard
In the early days of word processors, page breaks went wherever the page
 happened to end.
 There was no regard for what was actually going on in the text.
 You may remember once printing out a document, only to find the heading
 for a new section printed at the very bottom of the page, the first line
 of a new paragraph all alone at the bottom of a page, or the last line
 of a paragraph at the top of a new page.
 These bits of text became known as 
\emph on
widows
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
orphans
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, LyX can avoid breaking pages after a section heading.
 That's part of the advantage of paragraph environments.
 But what about widows and orphans, where the page breaks leave one line
 of a paragraph all alone at the top or bottom of a page? There are rules
 built into LaTeX governing page breaks, and some of those rules are there
 to specifically prevent widows and orphans.
 This is the advantage LyX has in using LaTeX as its backend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's no way we can go into how TeX and LaTeX decide to break a page,
 or how you can tweak that behavior.

 need to manually change each of them.

\begin_layout Standard
A table cell can contain text, inline equations, a figure, or another table.
 All these kinds of objects can be placed in the same cell.
 Font sizes and shapes can also be altered.
 But you can't put a special environment in a cell (like 
\family sans
Section*
\family default
, etc.), nor set spacing options etc.
 for the cell's paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have multi-line entries in table cells, you have to declare a fixed width
 for the column in the table dialog.
 Your text is then automatically split into multiple lines and the cell
 is enlarged vertically when the length of the text exceeds the given width.
 An example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

Floats makes it possible to get a high quality layout.
 Images and tables can evenly be spread to the pages to avoid whitespace
 and pages without text.
 As the floating often destroys the context between the text and the image/table
, every float can be referenced in the text.
 Floats are therefore numbered.
 Referencing is described in section

 exactly at the position where it is inserted.
 For this case you can use the option

 Use this option very rarely and only if the document is nearly ready to
 be printed.
 Because the float is then no longer able to

To create a math formula, you can just click on the toolbar icon 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/math-mode.png

\end_inset

.
 That will create a little blue rectangle, with purple markers around its
 corners.
 That blue rectangle is the formula itself; the purple markers indicate
 what level of nesting within the formula you are at.
 You can also choose a particular formula type to insert via the

Editing the parameters of a formula and adding math constructs can be done
 with the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two main types of formulas: Inline formulas appear within a text
 line, like this one:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a line with an inline formula 
\begin_inset Formula $A=B$
\end_inset

 in it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Displayed formulas appear outside the text like as they were in an own paragraph
, like this one:
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=B\]

\end_inset

You can only number and reference displayed formulas.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX supports also many LaTeX math commands.
 E.g.
 typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold

\backslash
alpha
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, followed by a space, in a formula will create the Greek letter

The best control over the cursor position within an existing formula is

 LyX uses small rectangles to indicate places where something can be inserted.
 The arrow keys can be used to navigate between parts of a formula.
 Pressing

In a formula you can insert accented characters in the same way as in text
 mode.
 This may depend on your keyboard, or the bindings file you use.
 You can also use LaTeX commands to e.g.
 enter 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}$
\end_inset

 even if your keyboard doesn't have hat-accents enabled.
 Our example is entered by typing 
\series bold

There are several brackets available through LyX.
 For most purposes, using just the keys

 should suffice.
 But if you want to surround a large structure, like a matrix or a fraction,
 or if you have several layers of brackets, is better using

 For example, that's how you would construct the brackets around a standard
 matrix such as:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
3 & 4\end{array}\right]\]

\end_inset

and to make it easier to see the layers of parentheses as in: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{\left(1+\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)}\right)\right)}\]

\end_inset

 The selection will be shown below the button field.
 If you want one side to not have a bracket, use the blank button.
 It will appear in LyX with a dotted line, but nothing will be printed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to place brackets around math structures, like a square root,
 you can do that by highlighting (selecting) the structure that is to go

 LyX proposes a

 For example, the sequence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the first column will be left-justified, the second will be
 centered, and the third column will be right-justified, because each letter
 corresponds to the relevant column.
 The result will look like this:
\begin_inset Formula \[

 It is recommended to use the proposed

\end_inset

Every labeled line is automatically numbered.
 Therefore the label is shown in LyX at the place of the formula number

\begin_layout Standard
LyX allows you to define macros for formulas.
 For example we assume that solutions of the quadratic equation often occur
 in our document in various forms and we want to create a macro to print
 them.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The general form of a quadratic equation is:
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\lambda^{2}+p\lambda+q\]

\end_inset

The general form of its solution is:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{1,2}=-\frac{p}{2}\pm\sqrt{\frac{p²}{4}-q}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The macro should print the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 like in the equation above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A macro is created by executing the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in the minibuffer at the bottom of the LyX screen.
 Name is the name of the new macro which mustn't contain numbers.
 The number of arguments can be a number in the range 1-9.
 If you want to define a macro without arguments, don't declare the number
 of arguments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have three arguments and name the macro 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

qE
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, so that the command is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The first box is an image to show the behavior in the output.
 The second one is the definition box, that doesn't appear in the output.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first blue box is for the definition, where you insert the formula via
 the math panel or commands.
 The placeholder for the arguments are inserted as a backslash and sharp
 followed by the argument number, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\backslash
#1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for the first argument.
 Placeholders will be displayed in red.
 The second blue box is for the appearance in LyX.
 This is useful when you have a large structure that shouldn't be displayed
 in LyX with its full size.
 If you want to see the macro as it is defined, leave the box blank.
 In our example we insert the sequence
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold
qE: 
\backslash
#1
\series default
 
\series bold
,
\series default
 
\series bold

\backslash

\series default
 
\series bold
,
\series default
 
\series bold

\backslash
#3
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series default
The macro will then be shown as the macro name followed by the three arguments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the macro in a formula, type its name as command, in our case 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold

\backslash
qE
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The macro is inserted with boxes for the arguments looking similar to this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/macrouse.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The arguments are inserted in the blue boxes.
 If the cursor is outside the macro, the arguments are put in the macro.
 To change the arguments, put the cursor in the formula before or after
 the macro and press the right or left arrow key respectively.
 The arguments appear now again below the macro definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you change the macro definition all macros are changed automatically
 to the new definition.
 Here an example of our macro with the arguments 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(x)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\qE x{\ln(y)}B\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the document is exported to LaTeX, the macro definition will be inserted
 as the command:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
newcommand{
\backslash
qE}[3]{#1_{1,
\backslash

\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset


\backslash
sqrt{
\backslash
frac{#2^{2}}{4}-#3}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The command is not inserted in the document preamble.
 That means you can only use macros in formulas that are below the macro
 definition box in your document.
 There are also some other restrictions: The command 
\backslash
newcommand supports optional arguments, which are not available in LyX's
 macros.
 You can also not change subsequently the name of the macro and the number
 of arguments.

Math ! Font sizes
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four font styles (relative sizes) used in math-mode, which are
 automatically chosen in most situations.
 These are called 
\family sans
textstyle
\family default
, 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
, 
\family sans
scriptstyle
\family default
, and 
\family sans
scriptscriptstyle
\family default
.
 For most characters, 
\family sans
textstyle
\family default
 and 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
 are actually the same size, but fractions, superscripts and subscripts,
 and certain other structures, are set larger in 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
.
 Except for some operators, which resize themselves to accommodate various
 situations, all text will be set in the styles as LaTeX thinks is appropriate.
 These choices can be overridden by using the math panel button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/math/style.png

\end_inset

.
 A box for the size will be created in which you can insert the math structure.
 For example, you can set 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, which is normally in 
\family sans
textstyle
\family default
, larger in 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
: 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 The four styles are used in the following example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $displaystyle$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle textstyle}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptstyle scriptstyle}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptscriptstyle scriptscriptstyle}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these math-mode font sizes are relative, that means, if the whole math
 inset is set in a particular size with the menu 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Text
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Style
\family default
, all sizes in the formula will be adjusted relative to this size.
 Similarly, if the base font size of the document is changed, all fonts
 will be adjusted to correspond.
 As example a formula in the font size 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

One of LyX's strengths are cross-references.
 You can reference every section, float, footnote, formula, and list in
 the document.
 To reference a document part, you have to insert a label into it.
 The label is used as anchor and name for the reference.
 We want for example refer to the the second item of the following list:
\end_layout

\family default
 or the by pressing the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics

.
 A grey label box like this: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/labelQt4.png

\end_inset

 is inserted and the label window pops up asking for the label text.
 LyX offers as text the first words of the item with a prefix, in our case
 the text 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 For the second method we use the paragraph environment

\begin_layout Standard
Within the

 with a number.
 If you click on it, you will get a dialog in which you can set a 
\family sans
Key
\family default
 and a 
\family sans
Label
\family default
.
 The key is the symbolic name by which you will refer to this bibliography
 entry.
 For example, our second entry in the bibliography is a book about LaTeX
 and we used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

latexcompanion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a short form of its title, as key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can refer to the key of a bibliography entry using the menu

 or the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics

.
 A citation reference box is inserted and a citation window will appear
 in which you can select one or more keys in the available key list.
 The citation reference box will be labeled with the referenced key.
 When you click on the box, the citation window appears and you can change
 the reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citation references appear in the output as number of the bibliography entry
 with surrounding brackets.
 If you set a

Bibliography databases are useful if you use the same bibliography in different
 documents.
 It makes it also very easy to have a uniform layout for all bibliography
 entries.
 You can collect the bibliography of all relevant books and articles of
 your working field in a database.
 This database can be used for different documents, because only the referenced
 entries of the database will appear in the bibliography list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database is a text file with the file extension 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 containing the bibliography in a special format.
 The format is explained in LaTeX books (

 They will be sorted in the order maïs, maître, maison, but we want the

 To achieve this, we use the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\begin_layout Standard
In our case we want to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

maison

\end_inset

maïs
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 and write therefore for the index entry of maison:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
maïs@maison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous entry needn't to be a real existing entry, you can also use
 another word to tell LaTeX the entry order, see the next subsection for
 an example.

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we encourage you to not format page numbers directly as shown
 above.
 Instead of this, you should define a macro in the preamble and use that.
 Consider why you want some page numbers to be bold.
 Maybe you want all page references italic that refer to a definition of
 the indexed term, so that users can easily find definitions.
 If so, put the following in preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
newcommand{
\backslash
IndexDef}[1]{
\backslash
textit{#1}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
into the index entry.
\begin_inset Index
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dummy entries ! my entry|IndexDef
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The advantage is that, if you change your mind later or if your publisher
 request that definitions must not be italic but bold, you just need to
 change the macro in the preamble, not every single index entry.

You can also change the layout for the whole index.

 We have shown above how to fix this sorting.
 However, if you are writing in another language and using Linux, consider

\begin_layout Standard
As LyX uses LaTeX in the background, it supports many LaTeX commands and
 constructs, but not all.
 LaTeX contains of hundreds of packages which provide different commands.
 Every time packages are updated and new ones added.
 This has the advantage that you can typeset nearly everything as there
 is for every problem a LaTeX-package.
 But LyX can of course not be up to date and support all packages and their
 commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But don't worry, you can use any LaTeX-command directly in LyX inside the
 TeX Code box.
 An TeX Code box is created by the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
TeX
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Code
\family default
 or by the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/ert-insert.png

\end_inset

.
 The box can be opened by left-clicking and closed by right-clicking on
 it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can insert complete or incomplete commands as TeX Code.
 Incomplete means that the command argument can be Standard LyX text.
 For example you want to draw a frame around a word and uses therefore the
 LaTeX-command 
\series bold

\backslash
fbox
\series default
, you can write the command part 
\series bold

\backslash
fbox{
\series default
 in a TeX Code box before the word and the closing brace 
\series bold
}
\series default
 in a second TeX Code box behind the word.
 The word between the two TeX Code boxes is then the argument as it is in
 the following example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you write larger documents or books, you will need to know something
 about the LaTeX-commands that LyX uses in the background.
 Because LaTeX is based on commands, you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

program
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 your text.
 This has the advantage that the layout of the document can be changed at
 every time if you know the right commands.
 E.g.
 imagine you have to write a manual for a product and the deadline is at
 the end of the day.
 Your boss just has complimented you for your good work but wants to have
 all caption labels bold.
 But you have over hundred figure and table captions with non-bold labels
 in your manual.
 Of course it's impossible to change all caption labels by hand in one day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now LaTeX comes into play.
 As written above, for every problem exists a LaTeX-package.
 First you have to find out which and therefore look in the LaTeX package
 database, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Catalogue"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As result you know that the package 
\series bold
caption
\series default

\begin_inset Index
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX-packages ! caption
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is what you need.
 To use a package, you have to load it in the document preamble (menu 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
) with the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
usepackage[options]{package name}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All LaTeX commands begin with a backslash, the command argument is set within
 two braces, and the options are set within two brackets.
 Note that not all commands have an argument and options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In your case the package name is 
\series bold
caption
\series default
.
 After a look in the documentation of the package, you know that the option
 
\series bold
labelfont=bf
\series default
 will change the font of all caption labels to bold.
 So you add the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
usepackage[labelfont=bf]{caption}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to the preamble and the problem is solved.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For more commands provided by the 
\series bold
caption
\series default
 package, have a look at its documentation, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "caption"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that some document classes have built-in solutions for well known problems
 like your case.
 For example if you use a 
\family sans
koma-script
\family default
 class, you don't need the package 
\series bold
caption
\series default
, you can instead write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
setkomafont{captionlabel}{
\backslash
bfseries}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in the preamble and the problem is solved.
 So if you plan to write a large document, you should have a look at the
 documentation of the document class you want to use.
 (
\series bold

\backslash
setkomafont
\series default
 is an example for a command with more than one argument.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commands in the preamble affects the whole document, while commands in the
 text affects only the text after the command or only the text used as command
 argument.
 To insert a LaTeX-command in text, use the TeX Code box as described in
 the previous section.

\family default
 check box in the insert dialog.
 This is useful if you wish to generate a preview of a LaTeX figure, for

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get previews working, you need the LaTeX package 
\series bold
preview-latex
\series default
 (on some systems named simply 
\series bold

\series default
) installed.
 In case it is not already installed, you find it in the TeX Catalogue,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "TeXCatalogue"

\end_inset

 or in the package manager of your LaTeX-system.
 You obtain prettier results if you install the program 
\family typewriter

\family default
 from the 
\family typewriter
netpbm
\family default
 package; for LyX on Windows this program is automatically installed together
 with LyX.

 and a window will be shown where you can see the LaTeX-source code.
 The window shows the source of the whole paragraph where the cursor is

 You can also select document parts in LyX's main window, then only this
 selection (when it is more than one paragraph) is shown as source code.
 To view the whole document as source, enable the corresponding option in
 the source view window.

Spell checking
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX itself has no built-in spell checker.
 Rather it uses one of the external programs 
\family typewriter
aspell
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
hspell
\family default
, or 
\family sans
pspell
\family default
 as backend.
 This section assumes you have already installed and set up one of these
 programs.
 
\family typewriter
aspell
\family default
 can be seen as successor of 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
, so that it is recommended to use aspell.
 
\family sans
hspell
\family default
 is a Hebrew spell-checker.
 The used spell checker ind its settings are specified in LyX's preferences
 under 
\family sans
Language Settings
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For LyX on Windows, the selection box for the spell checking program is
 greyed out in the preferences dialog because only 
\family sans
aspell
\family default
 can be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The menu
\family sans
 Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Spellchecker
\family default
 starts the spell checking beginning from the current cursor position.
 A dialog window will appear showing any incorrect (or unknown) word found,
 allowing you to edit and replace it in a second line.
 Whenever an unknown word is found, the word is highlighted and the text
 scrolled so that it is visible.
 In the 
\family sans
spell checker
\family default
 dialog, there is also a box showing suggestions for a correction, if any
 could be found.
 Clicking on one of the corrections will copy to the 
\family sans
Replace
\family default
 field, double-click invokes directly the replacement.
 Unknown but correctly typed words can be added to the personal dictionary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the used dictionary file is determined by the document language
 that is set in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator

 If you do not have a dictionary for the document language, spell checking
 will bring an error message.
 In this case, you can specify another dictionary file in the dialog by
 specifying a different 
\family sans

\family default
 in preferences dialog.

The review toolbar helps you to accept, reject, or merge changes -- highlight
 the change and press one of the desired toolbar buttons.
 When you merge changes, a window pops up showing you informations about
 the next change behind the current cursor position.
 So you don't need to highlight a certain change.
 Within the merge window you can decide to accept or reject changes and
 step to the next change.
 This way you can jump through all changes of the document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The toolbar has two buttons to handle notes because notes are often important
 to describe a change.
\end_layout

To show made changes in the output you need the LaTeX package

This section describes how to use LyX with any language you want.
 For some non-western languages there are special Wiki-pages that explain
 how to set up LyX to use them:

\begin_layout Standard
If you have for example a U.S.-style keyboard and want to write in a different
 language than English, you can use an alternate keymap.
 For example, if you have a U.S.-style keyboard but want to write in Italian,
 you can configure LyX to use an Italian keymap.
 The preferences dialog allows you to choose up to two keyboard mappings,
 see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Keyboard-Map"

\end_inset

.
 You can choose primary and secondary keyboard languages and then select
 which one you want to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you may just want to change a few key mappings or create an entirely
 different keymap (for Vulcan, for instance).
 You may, for example, normally write in Italian on a U.S.
 keyboard but want to include an occasional quotation in German.
 In such a case, you can write your own keyboard mapping or modify an existing
 one to support the characters you want.
 This and much more customizations are explained in the 
\emph on

 manual.

\begin_layout Standard
The document language and quote styles are set here.
 The encoding specifies how the document content is exported to LaTeX (the
 LyX file is always encoded in utf8).
 All characters that cannot be encoded using the specified encoding will
 be exported as LaTeX-commands (this can fail if a LaTeX-command is not
 known for a particular character).

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The known commands are defined in a text file.
 You can add commands for unknown symbols to that file yourself, see the
 
\emph on

 manual for details.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use the option 
\family sans
use language's default encoding
\family default
, LyX determines the encoding of a portion of text from the language of
 this text.
 If the document contains text in more than one language you may get more
 than one encoding in the LaTeX file.
 If you do not use this option then the complete document will always use
 exactly one encoding.
 Checking this option is the preferred setting unless you use 
\family sans
XeTeX

XeTeX is a TeX typesetting engine, an alternative for LaTeX.
 It natively supports Unicode while its input file is assumed to be in UTF-8
 encoding.
 More about using LyX with XeTeX can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (see below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX also supports Unicode output, which is particularly useful if you need
 lots of special symbols or non-alphabetic scripts, respectively.
 If you want to use this (and your LaTeX installation supports Unicode,
 for that matter), choose one of the four utf8 variants from the list below.
 Unfortunately the unicode support of standard LaTeX is quite incomplete,
 so it is not uncommon that a file with lots of unicode symbols works fine
 with 
\family sans
use language's default encoding
\family default
 (when LyX uses it's list of known LaTeX-commands), but does not work with
 a fixed utf8 encoding (when the list of known LaTeX-commands is not used,
 because all unicode symbols can be encoded in utf8).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a list with the important encodings:

 When using this, you probably need to load some other packages manually

 languages in TeX code.

\begin_layout Standard
The appearance of the menus and toolbars can be changed by choosing an user
 interface (ui) file.
 An ui-file is a textfile where the toolbars and menus are listed.
 The toolbar buttons and menu entries are specified in the files 
\shape italic
stdtoolbars.inc
\shape default
 and 
\shape italic
stdmenus.inc
\shape default
, respectively.
 Both files are loaded by the 
\emph on
default.ui
\emph default
 file.
 To create your own menu and toolbar layout, start with a copy of these
 files and edit the entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax of the .inc-files is straightforward: The 
\family sans
Menubar

\begin_layout Standard
There are also bind-files designed for special document classes, like 
\shape italic

 for Portuguese.
 If you use LyX in a certain language, LyX will try to use the appropriate
 bind-file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some bind-files, like 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
Here you find the list of defined converter commands to convert material
 from one format to another.
 You can modify them or create new ones.
 To modify a converter, select it, change the entry of the field 
\family sans
Converter
\family default
 and/or 
\family sans
Extra
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

flag
\family default
, and press the 
\family sans

\family default
 button.
 To create a new converter, select an existing one, select a different format
 in the 
\family sans
From
\begin_inset space ~

\family default
 drop-down list, modify the 
\family sans
Converter
\family default
 field, and press the 
\family sans
Add
\family default
 button.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When the 
\family sans
Converter File Cache
\family default
 is enabled, conversions will be cached as long as specified in the field
 
\family sans
Maximum Age (in days
\family default
).
 This means that images don't need to be converted again when you reopen
 a document; the converted images from the cache will be used instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More about converters, like the variables and flags that can be used in
 the converter definition, is described in section

\begin_layout Standard
Here you find the list of defined copiers.
 Since all conversions from one format to another take place in LyX's temporary
 directory, it is sometimes necessary to modify a file before copying it
 to the temporary directory in order that the conversion may be performed.
 This is done by a Copier.
