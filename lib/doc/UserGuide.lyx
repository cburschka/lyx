\begin_layout Section
What is LyX?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is a document preparation system.
 It is a tool for producing beautiful manuscripts, publishable books, business
 letters and proposals, and even poetry.
 It is unlike most other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word processors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that it uses the paradigm of a markup language as its core
 editing style.
 That means that when you type a section header, you mark it as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bold, 17
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

pt type, left justified, 5
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

mm space below
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 LyX takes care of the typesetting for you, so you deal only with concepts,
 not with mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This philosophy is explained in greater detail in the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\emph default
.
 If you haven't read it yet, you need to.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Introduction
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 describes several things in addition to LyX's philosophy: most importantly,
 the format of all of the manuals.
 If you don't read it, you will have a bear of a time navigating this manual.
 You might also be better served looking in one of the other manuals instead
 of this one.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
How LyX Looks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like most applications, LyX has the familiar menu bar across the top of
 its window.
 Below it is a toolbar with a pulldown box and various buttons.
 There is, of course, a vertical scrollbar and a main work area for editing
 documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is no horizontal scrollbar.
 This is not a bug or an oversight, but intentional.
 When you read a book, you expect the end of a line to wrap around to the
 next line.
 Text overflows onto new pages in a vertical fashion, hence the need for
 only a vertical scrollbar.
 There are three cases where you might want a horizontal scrollbar.
 The first case is large images.
 To avoid that they are displayed larger than your screen, use in the image
 settings the option 
\family sans
Scale on Screen
\family default
 in the tab 
\family sans
LaTeX and LyX options
\family default
.
 The second and third cases are tables and equations which are wider than
 the LyX window.
 You can use the arrow keys to scroll horizontally through the table, but
 this doesn't work for equations yet.
\end_layout

HELP
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The help system consists of the LyX manuals.
 You can read all of the manuals from inside LyX.
 Just select the manual you want to read from the 
\family sans

Preferences
\end_layout

\end_inset

 LyX is able to inspect your system to see what programs, LaTeX document
 classes and LaTeX packages are available.
 It uses this knowledge to give reasonable defaults for the preferences
 settings.
 Although this configuration has already been done when LyX was installed
 on your system, you might have some items that you installed locally, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can edit documents in LyX without having LaTeX installed, but you will
 not to able to create PDFs or print your documents unless you do have it
 installed.
 However, some LyX documents use DocBook as the `backend' that can produce
 PDFs and the like, and every LyX document can always be output as plain
 text or as XHTML.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some document classes may depend upon specific LaTeX or DocBook classes
 or packages.
 Such document classes can be used even if you do not have the required
 files installed, but you will not be able to produce certain kinds of output.

Like most modern word processors, LyX can perform cut and paste operations
 on blocks of text, can move by character, word, or page of text, and can
 delete whole words as well as individual characters.
 The next four sections cover the basic LyX editing features and how to
 access them.
 We will start with cut and paste.

LyX offers you several ways to navigate in documents:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The 
\family sans
Navigate
\family default
 menu lists all sections of the document as submenu entries that you can
 click to jump to the corresponding document part.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The `Outline', which is accessed either by the menu 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Outline
\family default
 or by the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "dialog-toggle toc"
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can set bookmarks in your document under 
\family sans
Navigate\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Bookmarks
\family default
 and use the same menu to return to them.
 Note that bookmarks are saved between sessions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "bookmark-goto 0"
\end_inset

 (also 
\family sans
Navigate\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Bookmarks\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Navigate
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Back
\family default
) jumps to the position in the document where you recently changed something.
 This is useful when you have a large document and have navigated or scrolled
 to another document part to look for something, and want to go back to
 your last editing position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By pressing the 
\family sans
F5
\family default
 key the cursor will be vertically centered in LyX's main window.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Outliner
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:The-Outliner"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the pull-down box at the top of the outline window, you can choose between
 several different lists, including other TOC-like objects, such as lists
 of tables and figures, but also lists of footnotes, or labels and cross-referen
ces (see sec.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Cross-References"

\end_inset

), or notes, or citations (see sec.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Bibliography"

\end_inset

).
 Clicking on any of these will take you to the corresponding object in your
 document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right-clicking on elements in the Outline opens in many cases a context
 menu that will allow for direct modification of those elements.
 For example, with citations, the context menu allows you to open the citation
 dialog and to modify the citation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The `Filter' field at the top allows you to restrict which entries appear
 in the Outline.
 For example, if you are displaying the list of Labels and References and
 wish to see only references to subsections, you can enter the text 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sub:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the filter, and only entries containing that text will be displayed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the bottom of the outline are several buttons and the like that allow
 you further to control the display.
 The 
\family sans
Sort
\family default
 option sorts the current list alphabetically.
 Otherwise, the elements appear in the order in which they occur in the
 document.
 The 
\family sans
Keep
\family default
 option keeps it in the current view state.
 Keeping means that when you have e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the subsections of section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 and 4 shown and click on section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

3, the subsections of section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 and 4 will still be shown.
 Without the 
\family sans
Keep
\family default
 option they will be hidden to highlight the clicked section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

3.
 Finally, the slider at the left can be used to open the Outline to a given
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

depth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is best just to experiment with it to see how it works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/reload.png

\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

button refreshes the TOC (though this should not usually be necessary).
 Next to it are buttons that allow you to change the position of sections
 in your document.
 The 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics

\end_inset


\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/up.png
	scale 85
	groupId toolbarbuttons

\end_inset


\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

 buttons move sections up and down in the document.
 So, for example, you can move section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2.5 before section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2.4 or after section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2.6.
 LyX will then automatically renumber the sections to the new order.
 With the buttons 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/promote.png
	scale 85
	groupId toolbarbuttons

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename ../images/demote.png
	scale 85
	groupId toolbarbuttons

\end_inset

 (or the corresponding key bindings 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Shift-Tab
\family default
) you can change the level of sections.
 So you can for example make section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2.5 chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

3 or subsection
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2.4.1.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX shows a small triangle behind the cursor as an indicator that there
 are completions available.
 Press the

 If several completions are possible, a popup is opened showing them.
 You can select a completion in the popup using the mouse or the arrow keys,
 and accept the chosen completion be pressing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The completion options for math in the preferences do the same as the correspond

 The special math option 
\family sans
Autocorrection
\family default
 enables that characters can be composed.
 If you for example want to insert the character

, you can then input the characters 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold

 to a formula to get it.
 So this is a quick alternative to the insertion of commands or the usage
 of the math toolbar.
 A list with supported character combinations can be found in the file 
\family typewriter

 that is somewhere in LyX's installation folder.
 Math autocorrection can at any time be turned on by pressing the exclamation

Before you do anything else, before you ever start writing a document, you
 need to decide what type of document you want to edit.
 Different types of documents use different types of spacing, headings,
 numbering schemes, and so on.
 Additionally, different documents use different paragraph environments,
 and format the title of your document differently.

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four standard document classes in LyX.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Article for basic articles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Report for basic reports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Book for writing a book
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Letter for US-style letters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also some non-standard classes, which LyX only uses if you have
 installed the corresponding LaTeX class files, though most LaTeX distributions
 will include many of these.
 Here are some of the classes.
 The full list with detailed explanations can be found in chapter 
\emph on
Special Document Classes
\emph default
 in the 
\emph on
Additional Features
\emph default
 manual:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\begin_layout Description
ACS For submissions to the journals published by the American Chemistry

\begin_layout Description
AGU For submissions to the journals published by the American Geophysical
 Union
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
AMS Layouts for articles and books in the style and format used by the American
 Mathematical Society (AMS).
 There are three article layouts available.
 The standard one uses a typical numbering scheme for theorems etc., that
 prepends the section number to the number of the result.
 All result-type statements (propositions, corollaries, and so on) are sequenced
 together, but definitions, examples, and the like have their own sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sequential numbering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scheme does not place the section number with each result, but numbers
 them throughout the article in a single sequence.
 Each type of result gets its own sequence.
 There is also a layout that dispenses with numbering of statements altogether.

 If you open a document that uses such a class, you will receive a warning
 saying that there are files that are required to produce output that are
 not installed.
 So it may seem that something is wrong.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nothing is wrong.
 LyX includes many more document classes than you will ever need to use,
 and some of them, like 
\family sans
IOP
\family default
, are highly specialized.
 LyX tries to support as many different types of documents as possible,
 and it includes almost one hundred different layout files, with a growing
 number.
 No LaTeX distribution will install by default all files that might be needed
 by some document class.
 There are just too many of them.
 That is why some of the document classes are unavailable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there is a document class you would like to use that is marked as 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Unavailable
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you just need to install the appropriate package files.
 The easiest way to find out which files you need to install is to use that
 document class for a new file.
 LyX will display a dialog that will list the missing files.

\begin_layout Standard
Although LyX provides support for many different sorts of documents, it
 does not include support for every document class people might want to
 use.
 For example, many universities provide LaTeX class files to be used for
 dissertations submitted to those universities.
 The LyX team cannot write layout files to support every one of these.
 There are too many.
 Fortunately, users can write their own layout files, and many users have
 done so.

Some modules require LaTeX packages or file format converters that are not
 always installed by default.
 LyX will warn you if you do not have a needed package or converter, and
 it will tell you what exactly you are missing.
 You can still use the module while editing your file, but you will not
 be able to export to PDF or print your document, since LyX will not be
 able to compile the LaTeX file without the missing prerequisites.
 If you want to be able to produce this kind of output, then you need to
 install the missing prerequisites and then reconfigure LyX by selecting

Modules are to LyX much as packages are to LaTeX: They are intended to be
 used in a variety of different documents.
 If you often find yourself needing the same sort of thing in different
 documents, you should consider writing a module for this purpose.
 Sometimes, however, a particular document has very special needs, but you
 need a specific inset or character style only that one time.
 You want something that is like a document's own LaTeX preamble.
 What you want is LyX's

Important Note
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you change a document class, LyX has to convert 
\emph on
everything
\emph default
 into the new class.
 That includes the paragraph environments.
 Some paragraph environments are standard, in so far as all of the document
 classes have them; but some classes have special paragraph environments.
 If this is the case, and you change the document class, LyX will mark the
 paragraphs whose styles it no longer understands as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unknown
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The name of the style is retained, in case you should want to go back to
 the old class.
 But these paragraphs will be output with no special formatting, so you
 will either need to create a new style yourself or else convert these paragraph
s manually to a style present in your new document class.

\begin_layout Standard
Before describing all of the various paragraph environments, we'd like to
 say a word or two about paragraph indentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone seems to have their own convention for separating paragraphs.
 Most Americans indent the first line of a paragraph.
 Others don't indent but put extra space between the paragraphs.
 If you choose indentation for paragraphs the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 paragraph of a section, or after a figure, an equation, a table, a list,
 etc., is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 indented.
 Only a paragraph following another paragraph gets indented.
 Note that the indentation behavior is different when you use another document
 language than English.
 LaTeX takes care that the indentation follows the rules of the used language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The space between paragraphs, like the line spacing, the space between headings
 and text — in fact, all of the spacings for just about everything are pre-coded
 into LyX.
 As we said, you don't worry about how much space to add between what.
 LyX takes care of that.
 In fact, these pre-coded vertical spacings aren't a single number but a
 range.
 That way, LyX can squish or stretch the space between lines to make sure
 figures fit on a page with text, so that sections don't start at the bottom
 of a page, and so on.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX does this when LyX goes to produce a printable file.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, pre-coded doesn't mean you can't change them.
 LyX gives you the ability to globally change 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of these pre-coded spacings.
 We will explain more later.

A paragraph environment is simply a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

container
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a paragraph which gives that paragraph certain properties.
 This can include a particular style of font, different margins, a numbering
 scheme, labels, and so on.
 Additionally, you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the different environments inside one another, allowing one environment
 to inherit some of the properties of another.
 The different paragraph environments totally replace the need for messy
 tab stops, on the fly margin adjustment, and other hold-overs from the
 days of typewriters.
 There are several paragraph environments that are specific to a particular
 document type.
 We will only be covering the most common ones here.
\end_layout

To choose a new paragraph environment, use the pull-down box 
\begin_inset Graphics

 LyX will change the environment of the

 paragraph in which the cursor sits.
 You can also change the environment of an entire group of paragraphs if
 you select them before choosing the new environment.

\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_layout Standard
LyX keeps the old paragraph environment when you hit 
\family sans

.
 Also the nesting depth is preserved (for more on nesting see section

\begin_layout Standard
The default paragraph environment is 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 for most classes.
 It creates a plain paragraph.
 If LyX resets the paragraph environment, this is the one it chooses.
 In fact, the paragraph you're reading right now (and most of the ones in
 this manual) are in the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can nest a paragraph using the 
\family sans

\family default
 environment in just about anything else, but you can't really nest anything
 in a 
\family sans

\family default
 environment.

\begin_layout Standard
A LaTeX title page has three parts: the title itself, the name(s) of the
 author(s) and a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

footnote
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for thanks or contact information.
 For certain types of documents, LaTeX places all of this on a separate
 page along with today's date.
 For other types of documents, the title 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 goes at the top of the first page of the document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX provides an interface to the title page commands through the paragraph
 environments 
\family sans
Title
\family default
, 
\family sans
Author
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Date
\family default
.
 Here's how you use them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Put the title of your document in the 
\family sans
Title
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Put the author name in the 
\family sans
Author
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you want the date to have a certain appearance, want to use a fixed date,
 or want other text to appear in place of today's date, put that text in
 the 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 environment.
 Note that using this environment is optional.
 If you don't provide any, LaTeX will automatically insert today's date.
 If you don't want any date, add the line
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\series bold

\backslash

\series default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

to the preamble of your document (menu

\begin_layout Standard
LyX labels each heading with a series of numbers, separated by periods.
 The numbers describe where in the document you are.
 Unlike the other headings, parts are numbered with Latin letters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Headings all subdivide your document into different pieces of text.
 For example, suppose you're writing a book.
 You group the book into chapters.
 LyX does similar grouping:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Part
\family default
 is divided into either 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
s or 
\family sans
Section
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans

 Not all document types use the

 In that case the

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, if you use the 
\family sans
Subsubsection
\family default
 environment to label a new sub-subsection, LyX labels it with its number,
 along with the number of the subsection, section, and, if applicable, chapter
 that it's in.
 For example: the fifth section of the second chapter of this book has the
 label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

You can also alter which sectioning levels get numbered and which ones appear

 Others start at

\begin_layout Standard
Some section or chapter titles, such as this one, can get quite long.
 This can cause trouble when there is limited horizontal space.
 For example, if the header of the page is set to show the current section
 title, a long title will protrude over the page margins and look awful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX allows you to specify a short title for section headings.
 This short title is used in the header and in the actual table of contents,
 avoiding the problem mentioned.
 To specify a short title, use the menu 
\family sans

 This also works for captions inside floats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The title of this section is a good example of using this feature.

Special Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following information applies to all section headings:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot do any nesting with these environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot use a margin note in any of these environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can only use inline math in these environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can use labels and cross-references to refer to their numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Quotes and Poetry line spacing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has three paragraph environments for writing poetry and quotations.
 They are 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
.
 Forget the days of changing line spacing and twiddling with margins.
 These three paragraph environments already have those changes built-in.
 They all widen the left margin and add a bit of extra space above and below
 the text they contain.
 They also allow nesting, so you can put a 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 in a 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, as well as in some other paragraph environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another feature of these three paragraph environments: they do
 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 when you start a new paragraph.
 So, you can type in that poem and merrily hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 without worrying about the paragraph environment changing on you.
 Of course, that means that, once you are done typing in that poem, you
 have to change back to the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment yourself.
\family sans

\family sans
Quotation

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've described the similarities of these three environments, it's
 time for the differences.
 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 are identical except for one difference: 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 uses extra spacing to separate paragraphs and never indents the first line.
 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 indents the first line of a paragraph and uses the same line spacing throughout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example of the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This is in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 I can keep writing, extending this line out further and further until it
 wraps.
 See – no indentation!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Here's the second paragraph of this quote.
 Again, there's no indentation, but there is extra space between me and
 the other paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another example, this time in the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
This is in the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 environment.
 If I keep writing, you will see the indentation.
 If your country uses a writing style that shows off new paragraphs by indenting
 the first line, then 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 is the environment for you! Well, you'd use it 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 you were quoting other text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Here's a new paragraph.
 I could ramble on and on, like a politician at election time.
 If I did that, though, you'd get bored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As the examples show, 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 is for those people who use extra space to separate paragraphs.
 They should put quotes in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 Those who use indentation to mark a new paragraph should use the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 paragraph environment for quoted text.

 It looks okay on screen, but in the printed version, the extra lines are
 indented a bit more than the first.
 Okay, so it's turned to prose and doesn't rhyme anymore.
 So sue me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
To break a line
\begin_inset Newline newline

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has four different paragraph environments for creating different kinds
 of lists.
 In the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments, LyX labels your list items with bullets or numbers, respectively.
 In the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 and 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environments, LyX lets you provide your own label.
 We will present the individual details of each type of list next after
 describing some general features of all four of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four paragraph environments for lists differ from the other environments
 in several ways.
 First, LyX treats each paragraph as a list item.
 Hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 but keeps the current environment and creates a new list item.
 The nesting depth is hereby kept.
 If you want to keep the paragraph environment but reset the current nesting
 depth, you can use 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "break-paragraph inverse"
\end_inset

 to break paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can nest lists of any type inside one another.
 In fact, LyX changes the labels on some list items depending on how it
 is nested.
 If you intend to use any of the list paragraph environments, we suggest
 you read all of section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first type of list we will describe in detail is the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 paragraph environment.
 It has the following properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each item has a particular bullet or symbol as its label.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
LyX uses the same symbol for all of the items in a given nesting level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The symbol appears at the beginning of the first line.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The items can have any length.
 LyX automatically offsets the left margin of each item.
 The offset is always relative to whatever environment the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list may be in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you nest an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment inside another 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, the label changes to a new symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are four different symbols for up to a four-fold nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX always shows the same symbol on screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
See section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Nesting"

\end_inset

 for a full explanation of nesting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Of course, that explanation was also an example of an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list.
 The 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment is best suited for lists where the order doesn't matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We said that different levels use different symbols as their label.
 Here's an example of all four possible symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the first level 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 is a large black dot, or bullet.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the second level is a dash.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the third is an asterisk.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the fourth is a centered dot.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back out to the third level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back to the second level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back to the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the default labels for an 
\family sans

\family default
 list.
 You can customize these labels in the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment is used to create numbered lists and outlines.
 It has these properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each item has a numeral as its label.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The label type depends on the nesting depth.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
LyX automatically counts the items for you and updates the label as appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each new 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment resets the counter to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Like the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Offsets the items relative to the left margin.
 Items can have any length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduces the space between items as the nesting depth increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Uses different types of labels depending on the nesting depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allows up to a four-fold nesting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 shows the different labels for each item in LyX.
 Here is how LyX labels the four different levels in an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first level of an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 uses Arabic numerals followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The second level uses lower case letters surrounded by parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The third level uses lower-case Roman numerals followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The fourth level uses capital letters followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Again, notice the decrease in the spacing between items as the nesting depth
 increases.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the third level
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the second level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, you can customize the type of numbering used in the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
 It involves adding commands to the LaTeX preamble (see the 
\emph on
Additional Features
\emph default
 manual).
 As stated earlier, such customization only shows up in the printed version,
 not in LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is more to nesting 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments than we've stated here.
 You should read section

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the previous two environments, the 
\family sans

\family default
 list has no fixed label.
 Instead, LyX uses the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the first line as the label.
 Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: This is an example of the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX typesets the label in boldface and puts extra space between it and the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Usage: You should use the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment for things like definitions and theorems.
 Use it when you need to make one word in particular stand out in the text
 that describes it.
 It's not a good idea to use a 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment when you have an entire sentence that you want to describe.
 You're better off using 
\family sans
Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 list the 
\family sans
Labeling
\family default
 list has user-defined labels for each list item but it provides some additional
 features.
 Here are its properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
item
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

labels LyX uses the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of each line as the item label.
 The first 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 after the beginning of the first line of an item marks the end of the label.
 If you need to use more than one word in an item label, use a protected
 blank as described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
margins As you can see, LyX uses different margins for the item label and
 the body of the item text.
 The body of the text has a larger left margin, which is equal to the default
 label width plus a little extra space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
label
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

width LyX uses the width of the label, or the default width, whatever is
 larger.
 If the label width is larger, the label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the first line.
 In other words, the text of the first line isn't aligned with the left
 margin of the rest of the item text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000
default
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

width You can set the default label width to ensure that the text of all
 items in a 
\family sans

\begin_inset Newline newline

To change the default width, select all items in the list.

 The text in the box 
\family sans

 determines the default label width.
 You can use the text of your largest label here, but you can also use the
 letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 multiple times instead.
 The M is the widest character and is a standard unit of widths in LaTeX.
 By using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as the unit of width you don't need to keep changing the contents of

 (equal to 6

\begin_layout Standard
You should use the

 it.
 The

\family sans
Right
\begin_inset space ~

.
 To use the letter class, you need to use specific paragraph environments

 paragraph environments anywhere with no problem.
 You can even nest them inside other environments, though you can't nest

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans

\family default
 environment formats text in the style of an address, which is also used
 for the opening and signature in some countries.
 Similarly, the 
\family sans
Right
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 environment formats text in the style of a right-justified address, which
 is used for the sender's address and today's date in some countries.
 Here's an example of each:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Right Address

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was 
\family sans

\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address

 Notice that the lines all have the same left margin, which LyX sets to
 fit the largest block of text on a single line.
 Here's an example of the 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Address
Who are you
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Where do I send this
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Your post office and country

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, both 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Address
\family default
 add extra space between themselves and the next paragraph.
 If you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 in either of these environments, LyX resets the nesting depth and sets
 the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 This makes sense, since 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 function, and the individual lines of an address are not paragraphs.
 Thus, you have to use 
\family typewriter

 LyX contains paragraph environments for both of these.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment is used for the abstract of an article.
 Technically, you could use this environment anywhere, but you really should
 only use it at the beginning of the document, after the title.
 Also, don't bother trying to nest 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 in anything else or vice versa.
 It will not work.
 The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment is only useful in the article and report document classes.
 The book document classes ignores the 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 completely, and it's utterly silly to use 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 in a letter document class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment does several things for you.
 First, it puts the centered label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above the text.
 The label and the text of the abstract are separated by some extra vertical
 space.
 Second, it typesets everything in a smaller font, just as you'd expect.
 Lastly, it adds a bit of extra vertical space between the abstract and
 the subsequent text.
 Well, that's how it will appear on the LyX screen.
 The appearance in the output depends on the used article or report class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting a new paragraph by hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does not reset the paragraph environment.
 The new paragraph will still be in the 
\family sans

 environment.
 So, you will have to change the paragraph environment yourself when you
 finish entering the abstract of your document.

\family default
 environment, but since this document is in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class, we can't do this.
 We inserted it therefore as figure
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Paragraph-in-the"

\end_inset

.
 If you've never heard of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 before, you can safely ignore this environment.

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment is used to list references.
 Technically, you could use this environment anywhere, but you really should
 only use it at the end of the document.
 Nesting 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 in anything else or vice versa will not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you first open a 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment, LyX adds a large vertical space, followed by the heading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bibliography
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

References,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 depending on the document class.
 The heading is in a large boldface font.
 Each paragraph of the 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment is a bibliography entry.
 Thus, hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does not reset the paragraph environment.
 Each new paragraph is still in the 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another, usually better way to include references in your document
 by using a BibTeX database.
 For more information on that, and for a detailed description of LyX's bibliogra
phy handling, have a look at section
\begin_inset space ~

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment is another LyX extension.
 It type-sets text in a typewriter-style font.
 It also treats the 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 key as a fixed whitespace;
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default

\family sans
Space

 key is treated as a 
\family sans
Protected
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Blank
\family default
 instead of an end-of-word marker.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 this is the only case in which you can type multiple whitespaces in LyX.
 If you need to insert blank lines, you will still need to use 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "newline-insert newline"
\end_inset

 (the 
\family typewriter
break-line
\family default
 function).
 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 breaks paragraphs.
 Note, however, that 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does not reset the paragraph environment.
 So, when you finish using the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment, you will need to change the paragraph environment yourself.
 Also, you can nest the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment inside of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few quirks with this environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot use 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "newline-insert newline"
\end_inset

 at the beginning of a new paragraph (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

you can't follow 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 with a 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "newline-insert newline"
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can't follow a 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "newline-insert newline"
\end_inset

 with a 
\family sans

\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Use a 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 to begin a new paragraph, then you can use a 
\family sans
Space
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Or: use 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "space-insert protected"
\end_inset

 instead.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You can't have an empty paragraph or an empty line.
 You must put at least one 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 in any line you want blank.
 Otherwise, LaTeX generates errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot get the typewriter double quotes by typing 
\family sans

\family default
 since that will insert 
\emph on
real

 You get the typewriter double quotes with 
\begin_inset Info

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX treats text as a unified block with a particular context and specific
 properties.
 This allows you to create blocks that inherit some of the properties of
 another block.
 For example you have three main points in an outline, but point #2 also
 has two subpoints.
 In other words, you have a list inside of another list, with the inner
 list 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attached
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to item #2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
one
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
two
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
sublist – item #1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
sublist – item #2
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You put a list inside a list by nesting one list inside the other.
 Nesting an environment is quite simple: Select

List

\end_inset

Depth
\family default
 from the 
\family sans
Edit
\family default
 menu to change the nesting depth of the current paragraph (the status bar
 will tell you how far you are nested).
 Instead of the menu, you can also use the toolbar buttons 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "depth-increment"
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "depth-decrement"
\end_inset

 or the convenient key bindings 
\family sans
Tab
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Shift-Tab
\family default
 or 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "depth-increment"
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "depth-decrement"
\end_inset

 to change the nesting level.
 The change will work on the current selection if you have made one (allowing
 you to change the nesting of several paragraphs at once), or the current
 paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that LyX only changes the nesting depth if it can.
 If it's invalid to do so, nothing happens if you try to change the depth.
 Additionally, if you change the depth of one paragraph, it affects the
 depth of every paragraph nested inside of it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nesting isn't limited to lists.
 In LyX, you can nest just about anything inside anything else, as you're
 about to find out.
 This is the real power of nesting paragraph environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What You Can and Can't Nest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we fire a list of paragraph environments at you, we need to tell
 you a little bit more about how nesting works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question if nesting a paragraph environment is possible, is a bit more
 complicated than a simple yes or no.
 There are three types of paragraph environments:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Completely unnestable
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fully nestable, you can nest them inside things and you can also nest other
 things inside them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
A third type, you can nest them into other environments, but you can't nest
 anything into them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a list of the three types of nesting behavior, and which paragraph
 environments have them:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Usage and General Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of levels, LyX can perform up to a six-fold nesting.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

level #6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the innermost possible depth.
 Here's an example to illustrate what we mean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
level #1 – outermost
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #2
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #3
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #4
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
level #6
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
There are two exceptions to the six-fold nesting limit, and you can see
 both of them in the example.
 Unlike the other fully-nestable environments, you can only perform a four-fold
 nesting with the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments.
 For example, if we tried to nest another 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 list inside item 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we would get errors.

 Now, what happens if we nest an

 (We got here by using

\begin_inset Info

 We will do that again\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

to get to level #5.
 This time, however, we also changed the paragraph environment back to 
\family sans

.
 Notice the type of numbering, it is 
\emph on
lowercase Roman
\emph default
, because we are in the 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What happens if we 
\emph on
don't
\emph default
 change the paragraph environment, but decrease the nesting depth? What
 type of numbering does LyX use?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Oh, as if you couldn't guess by now, we're just using 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "break-paragraph inverse"
\end_inset

 to keep the current environment and depth but create a new item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's use 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "depth-decrement"
\end_inset

 to decrease the depth after the next 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "break-paragraph inverse"

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #4.
 Look what type of label LyX is using!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #3.
 Even though we've changed levels, LyX is still using a lowercase Roman
 numeral as the label.Why?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because, even though the nesting depth has changed, the paragraph is 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 a thirdfold 
\family sans

 Notice, however, that LyX 
\emph on
did
\emph default
 reset the counter for the label.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Another

 sequence, and we're back to level #2.
 This time, we not only changed the nesting depth, but we also moved back
 into the twofold-nested 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The same thing happens if we do another 
\begin_inset Info

\begin_inset Info

\end_inset

sequence and return to level #1, the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we reset the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 As you can see, the level number doesn't correspond to what type of labeling
 LyX uses for the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments.
 The number of other 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments surrounding it determines what kind of label LyX uses for
 an 
\family sans

 item.
 The same rule applies for the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Horizontal fills (HFills) are a special LyX feature for adding extra space
 in a uniform fashion.
 An HFill is actually a variable length space, whose length always equals
 the remaining space between the left and right margins.
 If there is more than one HFill on a line, they divide the available space
 equally between themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are a few examples of what you can do with them:

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mr.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Edge
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 To get this, you can use the phantom insets available via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Formatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Phantom
\family default
.
 In our case insert a horizontal phantom at the beginning of the last two

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Mr.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Edge
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the phantom inset (note the space after 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Edge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 A phantom insets prints only the space of its content (like a placeholder).
 That is why it is named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phantom
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The normal phantom outputs the width and height of the content as space,
 while the horizontal and vertical variant only outputs the corresponding
 dimension.

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't like the way LaTeX does the page breaks in your document, you
 can force a page break where you want one.
 Normally this will not be necessary, because LaTeX is good at page breaking.
 Only if you use a lot of 
\family sans
Floats
\family default
, LaTeX's page breaking algorithm can fail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We recommend not to use forced page breaks until the text is finished and
 until you have checked in the preview to see if you 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 have to change the page breaking.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two types of page breaks: One that ends the page without any special
 action.
 This can be inserted above or below a paragraph via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Formatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Page
\family default
.
 The second type, that is inserted via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Formatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Page
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Break
\family default
, ends a page but stretches the content of the page, so that it fills out
 the complete page.
 This type is useful to avoid whitespace when a page break produces a page
 on which only the last few lines are absent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might try to use a page break to ensure that a figure or table appears
 at the top of a page.
 This is, of course, the wrong way to do it.
 LyX gives you a way of automatically ensuring that your figures and tables
 appear at the top of a page (or the bottom, or on their own page) without
 having to worry about what precedes or follows your figure or table.

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than forced page breaks where the content behind the break is placed
 directly on the next page, you can also clear pages while breaking them.
 That means that the current paragraph is terminated and everything, including
 unprocessed floats, from the earlier part of the document are placed behind
 it, if necessary by adding pages.
\end_layout

 in justified paragraphs due to possible whitespace introduced by line breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You shouldn't use forced line breaks to correct LaTeX's line breaking, as
 LaTeX is very good at line breaking.
 There are, however, a number of situations where it is necessary to actively
 set a line break, e.

 are fonts, built from outlines of the single glyphs (e.

 characters) in the font.
 This means that each glyph is defined using mathematical curves that are
 well suited for scaling to any requested size.
 This mathematical definition is interpreted by the font renderer and the
 curve is filled out with pixels according to the size and glyph.
 This means that vector fonts will look pretty good in all sizes.
 Only at very small sizes where each pixel has to be very carefully computed
 to provide a good image, it might be hard to provide a good rendering.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

That could mean that one only needs to define one font size and scale them.
 But to achieve a better quality, many fonts define several font sizes.
 That improves the appearance because you need more details at large font
 sizes than at small ones.

 It is the same effect that happens if you try to enlarge a picture in a
 picture manipulation program.
 In order to relieve this effect, bitmap fonts are typically provided in
 several fixed sizes typically from around 8 pixels high up to 34 pixels
 or so high in steps according to what is believed to be useful.
 The advantage of bitmap fonts is that no complicated computations are necessary
 to display each glyph, so bitmap fonts are thus faster displayed than scalable
 fonts.
 The disadvantage is that sizes that don't exist as fixed versions have
 to be scaled by doubling pixels, and thus look bad.

Bitmap fonts are named

 in PostScript- and PDF-documents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of all this is that bitmap fonts are best for the size they are
 designed for, while scalable fonts are good for nearly all sizes.
 So one needs fewer font size definitions for scalable fonts.
 That's the reason why nearly all text rendering and typesetting programs
 use scalable fonts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To test which fonts are used in a PDF-document, you can have a look into
 its document properties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many modern typesetting and markup languages have begun to move towards
 specifying character styles rather than specifying a particular font.
 For example, instead of changing to an italicized version of the current
 font to emphasize text, you use an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emphasized style
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead.
 This concept fits in perfectly with LyX.
 In LyX, you do things based on contexts, rather than focusing on typesetting
 details.

LaTeX font support

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Traditionally, LaTeX uses its own fonts.
 That is to say, you cannot directly access the fonts installed on your
 operating system, but you have to use specific fonts provided by your LaTeX
 distribution.
 The reason is that LaTeX needs some extra information about the fonts,
 which have to be provided by additional files and packages.
 The downside of this is that your font choice is somewhat limited, compared
 to usual word processors.
 On the other hand this comes with the advantage that the provided fonts
 are generally of very good quality, and that LaTeX files are very portable
 across different machines.
 Also, the range of fonts supported by traditional LaTeX was increased a
 lot meanwhile so that you can find packages for many free and commercial
 fonts.
 In LyX, only a subset of these are directly selectable via the user interface
 (see section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Document-Font"

\end_inset

 for details).
 However, all others are available if you enter the respective LaTeX code
 in the document preamble (please refer to the documentation of your desired
 font).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recent developments brought some new LaTeX engines that are also able to
 directly access fonts that are installed for your operating system, namely
 XeTeX and LuaTeX.
 Both engines are supported by LyX.
 By using them, you can use theoretically any OpenType or TrueType font
 that is installed on your system.
 The next section describes how to use these fonts.

Toggling
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 refers to applying or removing font properties.
 When a property is marked for toggling in the Text Style dialog, applying
 the style to text that already has the property will cause the property
 to be removed.
 If you for example apply a style with properties A, B and C to text that
 currently has font properties B, C, F and G, and if B is set to toggle
 and C is set not to toggle, the text ends up with properties A, C, F and
 G.

 For the properties on the left side of the dialog (

 If

Now that we have covered some of the basic features of document preparation

LyX uses the program LaTeX as its backend.
 LaTeX is just a macro package for the TeX typesetting system, but to prevent
 confusion, we will only refer to LaTeX.
 LyX is what you use to do your actual writing.
 Then, LyX calls LaTeX to turn your writing into printable output.
 This happens in two stages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

 generating a file with the extension,

DVI files do not contain images, they only link to them.

 You can also use any other image format, because LyX converts them in the

 But as described in the section about PostScript, the image conversion

 So we recommend using images in one of the three mentioned formats.

When LyX calls LaTeX to generate the final version of your document, LaTeX
 automatically distinguishes between words, sentences, and abbreviations.
 LaTeX then adds the

 gets after another word.

It is standard typesetting practice to group certain letters together and
 print them as single characters.
 These groups are known as 
\emph on

 Since LaTeX knows about ligatures, your documents will contain them too
 in the output.
 Here are the standard ligatures:

\begin_layout Standard
Some languages uses other ligatures if the document font supports them.
\end_layout

Sometimes, you don't want a ligature in a word.
 While a ligature may be okay in the word,

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Typography ! Widows and orphans
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early days of word processors, page breaks went wherever the page
 happened to end.
 There was no regard for what was actually going on in the text.
 You may remember once printing out a document, only to find the heading
 for a new section printed at the very bottom of the page, the first line
 of a new paragraph all alone at the bottom of a page, or the last line
 of a paragraph at the top of a new page.
 These bits of text became known as 
\emph on
widows
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
orphans
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, LyX can avoid breaking pages after a section heading.
 That's part of the advantage of paragraph environments.
 But what about widows and orphans, where the page breaks leave one line
 of a paragraph all alone at the top or bottom of a page? There are rules
 built into LaTeX governing page breaks, and some of those rules are there
 to specifically prevent widows and orphans.
 This is the advantage LyX has in using LaTeX as its backend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's no way we can go into how TeX and LaTeX decide to break a page,
 or how you can tweak that behavior.
 Some LaTeX books listed in the bibliography (such as
\begin_inset space ~

 We say

 In this case only a header with the image properties is added to the original

\begin_layout Standard
Each image can define a new group of image settings or join an existing
 group.
 Images within such a group share their settings, so adjusting one image
 of the group automatically also adjusts all other images of the group in
 the same way.
 So you can for example change the size for a bunch of images without the
 need to manually change each of them.

A new group can be set by entering a name in the

 Joining an existing group can be done using the context menu of the image
 by checking the name of the desired group.

 A dialog will appear, asking you for the number of rows and columns.
 The default table has lines around any cell and the first row appears separated
 from the rest of the table.
 This separation appears due to a double line: The cells of the first row
 have a line below them and the cells of the second row have a line above
 them.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can alter a table by clicking on it with the right mouse button and
 then choosing 
\family sans
More\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
.
 This brings up the table dialog.
 Here you can adjust the settings of the cell, row and/or column where the
 cursor is placed currently.
 Most of the dialog options also work on selections.
 This means that if you select more cells, columns or rows the action is
 done on all of your selection.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to the table dialog, the 
\family sans
table
\begin_inset space ~

 It appears if the cursor is inside a table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the tab 
\family sans
Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Settings
\family default
 of the table dialog you can set the alignment for the current row.
 If you add a row or column, it will be inserted right beside or below the
 current cell respectively.
 The vertical alignment of a column can only be adjusted when a column width
 is given.
 A given width will allow the cell to have line breaks and multiple paragraphs
 of text, see section

You can mark multiple cells of one row/column as a multicolumn/row cell
 using the check box 
\family sans
Multicolumn
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Multirow

.
 This will merge the cells to 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 cell, spread over more than one column/row.
 Multicolumn cells are treated as own rows, so that the alignment, width,
 and border settings affect only the multicolumn cell.
 Here is an example table with a multicolumn cell in the first row and one
 in the last row without the upper border:

\begin_layout Standard
A table cell can contain text, inline equations, a figure, or another table.
 All these kinds of objects can be placed in the same cell.
 Font sizes and shapes can also be altered.
 But you can't put a special environment in a cell (like 
\family sans
Section*
\family default
, etc.), nor set spacing options for the cell's paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To have multi-line entries in table cells, you have to declare a fixed width
 for the column in the table dialog.
 Your text is then automatically split into multiple lines and the cell
 is enlarged vertically when the length of the text exceeds the given width.
 An example:

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A float is a block of text associated with some sort of label, which doesn't
 have a fixed location.
 It can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

float
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 forward or backward a page or two, to wherever it fits best.
 
\family sans
Footnotes
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Margin
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Notes
\family default
 are also floats, because they can float to the next page when there are
 too many notes on the current page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Floats make it possible to get a high quality layout.
 Images and tables can be distributed evenly over the pages to avoid whitespace
 and pages without text.
 As the floating often destroys the spatial context between the text and
 the image/table, every float can be referenced in the text.
 Floats are therefore numbered.
 Referencing is described in section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To insert a float, use the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Float
\family default
.
 A box with a caption will be inserted into your document.
 The label will automatically be translated to the document language in
 the output.
 After the label you can insert the caption text.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The image or table is inserted above or below the caption in a separate
 paragraph within the float.
 To keep your LyX-document readable, you can open and close the float box
 by left-clicking on the box label.
 A closed float box looks like this:

\end_inset

 – a gray button with a red label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is recommended to insert floats as a separate paragraph to avoid possible
 LaTeX-errors that can occur when the surrounding text is specially formatted.

\family default
 or the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info

.
 It is important to use references to figure floats, rather than using vague
 references like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the figure above
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, because, as LaTeX will reposition the floats in the final document, it
 might not be

 at all.

Normally only one image is inserted in a figure float, but sometimes you
 might want to use two images with separate subcaptions.
 This can be done by inserting image floats into existing image floats.

\begin_layout Standard
The best control over the cursor position within an existing formula is
 achieved with the arrow keys.
 LyX uses small rectangles to indicate places where something can be inserted.
 The arrow keys can be used to navigate between parts of a formula.
 Pressing

Sum (

 These limits can be entered in LyX by entering them as you would enter
 a super- or subscript, directly after the symbol.
 The sum operator will automatically place its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

limits

 formulas.
 Such as

\end_inset

, versus
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum\nolimits _{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}=e

Integral signs, however, will place the limits on the side in both formula

 This generates a small space, and shows a small marker on the screen.
 For example, the sequence

 You can change the space to different sizes when you set the cursor behind
 the space marker and hit space again several times.
 With every space hit the size will be changed.
 Some markers for the space size appear red in LyX, because they are negative
 spaces.

\begin_layout Standard
There are several brackets available through LyX.
 For some purposes, using just the keys 
\family typewriter
[]{}()|<>
\family default
 should suffice.
 But if you want to surround a large structure, like a matrix or a fraction,
 or if you have several layers of brackets, it is better to use the math
 toolbar delimiter icon 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "dialog-show mathdelimiter"
\end_inset

.
 For example, that is how you would construct the brackets around a matrix:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
3 & 4
\end{array}\right]
\]

\end_inset

and to make it easier to see the layers of parentheses.
 Below, the expression on the left was entered using the delimiter icon
 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "dialog-show mathdelimiter"
\end_inset

 and the expression on the right was entered using the 
\family typewriter
()
\family default
 keys.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\left(1+\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)}\right)\right)}\qquad\qquad\frac{1}{(1+(\frac{1}{1+(\frac{1}{1+x})}))}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use the delimiter icon, the parentheses, and other brackets from
 that menu will automatically re-size to accommodate the size of what is
 inside.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To construct brackets click on the button for the bracket you want on the
 left side and right side.
 If you use the option 
\family sans
Keep
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

matched
\family default
, the selected bracket type will be used for the left and the right side.
 The selection will be shown below the button field.
 If you want one side to not have a bracket, use the blank button.
 It will appear in LyX with a dotted line, but nothing will be printed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to place brackets around math structures, like a square root,
 you can do so by first highlighting (selecting) the structure that is to
 go inside the brackets.
 Then choose the appropriate brackets for left and right and click on 
\family sans
Insert
\family default
.
 The parentheses will be drawn around the selected structure.
 The most common bracket combinations (parentheses, square brackets, and
 braces, on both sides) can be entered more quickly using keyboard shortcuts.
 For example, to insert a pair of flexible parentheses on both sides, select
 the structure and enter 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "math-delim ( )"
\end_inset

 LyX proposes a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for every column as default.
 For example, the sequence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the first column will be left-justified, the second will be
 centered, and the third column will be right-justified, because each letter
 corresponds to the relevant column.
 The result will look like this:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{array}{lcr}
this & this\, column & this\, column\\
column & has & has\, right\\
has\, left\, alignment & center\, alignment & alignment

 within a formula.
 In an empty formula you can see that three blue boxes appear, one for each
 column.
 When you press 
\begin_inset Info

\end_inset

 in a non-empty formula, the part before the relation sign (equal sign 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

 etc.) will be inserted automatically in the first column, the relation sign
 is in the second column, and the rest in the third column.
 A new row is created by every further hit of 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "newline-insert newline"
\end_inset

.
 Multi-line formulas are always displayed formulas.
 Here is an example:
\begin_inset Formula

a & = & \sqrt{b^{4}-c^{4}}\label{eq:asquared}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Note that the middle column is designed for relation signs so structures
 in this column will be printed in a smaller size:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{A}{B} & \frac{A}{B} & \frac{A}{B}

\end_inset

 It is recommended to use the proposed

 as the first part of the label, because this helps later to identify the
 label type when you have many labels in your document.
 We inserted in the following example the label

\end_inset

Every labeled line is automatically numbered.
 Therefore the label is shown in LyX at the place of the formula number
 placeholder

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Math ! Font sizes
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four font styles (relative sizes) used in math-mode, which are
 automatically chosen in most situations.
 These are called 
\family sans
textstyle
\family default
, 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
, 
\family sans
scriptstyle
\family default
, and 
\family sans
scriptscriptstyle
\family default
.
 For most characters, 
\family sans
textstyle
\family default
 and 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
 are actually the same size, but fractions, superscripts and subscripts,
 and certain other structures, are set larger in 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
.
 Except for some operators, which resize themselves to accommodate various
 situations, all text will be set in the styles that LaTeX thinks are appropriat
e.
 These choices can be overridden by using the math panel button 
\family sans

\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "math-insert \\style"
\end_inset


\family default
.
 A box for the size will be created in which you can insert the math structure.
 For example, you can set 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, which is normally in 
\family sans
textstyle
\family default
, larger in 
\family sans
displaystyle
\family default
: 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 The four styles are used in the following example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula $displaystyle$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle textstyle}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptstyle scriptstyle}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptscriptstyle scriptscriptstyle}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these math-mode font sizes are relative so that if the whole math inset
 is set in a particular size with the menu 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Text
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Style
\family default
, all sizes in the formula will be adjusted relative to this size.
 Similarly, if the base font size of the document is changed, all fonts
 will be adjusted to correspond.
 As an example here is a formula in the font size 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

largest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:

\begin_layout Standard
One of LyX's strengths is cross-references.
 You can reference every section, float, footnote, formula, and list in
 the document.
 To reference a document part, you have to insert a label into it.
 The label is used as an anchor and a name for the reference.
 We want for example to refer to the second item of the following list:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:Second-item"

\end_inset

Second item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Third item
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we insert a label into the second item with the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Label
\family default
 or by pressing the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "label-insert"
\end_inset

.
 A gray label box like this: 
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename clipart/labelQt4.png
	scale 85

\end_inset

 is inserted and the label window pops up asking for the label text.
 LyX offers as text the first words of the item with a prefix, in our case
 the text 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
enu:Second-item
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The prefix 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

enu:
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

enumerate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The prefix depends on the document part where the label is inserted, e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

if you insert a label into a section heading, the suggested prefix will
 be

\begin_inset Info

\begin_inset Graphics

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

BibTeX-database

 which is explained in the next subsection, or you can insert the bibliography
 manually, using the paragraph environment 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
, which was described in section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Biblio_environment"

\end_inset

.
 If you want anything other than numerical citations that are used in this
 document, like author-year citations, then you must
\emph on
 
\emph default
use a bibliography database.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Bibliography Environment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Within the 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment, every paragraph begins with a gray bibliography box labeled
 with a number.
 If you click on it, you will get a dialog in which you can set a 
\family sans
Key
\family default
 and a 
\family sans
Label
\family default
.
 The key is the symbolic name by which you will refer to this bibliography
 entry.
 For example, our second entry in the bibliography is a book about LaTeX
 and we used 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

latexcompanion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, a short form of its title, as the key.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can refer to the key of a bibliography entry using the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Citation
\family default
 or the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "dialog-show-new-inset citation"
\end_inset

.
 A citation reference box is inserted and a citation window will appear
 in which you can select one or more keys in the available key list.
 The citation reference box will be labeled with the referenced key.
 When you click on the box, the citation window appears and you can change
 the reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Citation references appear in the output as the number of the bibliography
 entry with surrounding brackets.
 If you set a 
\family sans
Label
\family default
 for the entry, the label will appear instead of the number.
 Here are two examples; the first without a label, the second with the label

Bibliography databases are useful if you use the same bibliography in different
 documents.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
They are also useful for keeping a database of articles and notes concerning
 them.
 Most of the database programs mentioned below allow you to store annotations
 and reviews along with bibliographical information.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It also makes it very easy to have a uniform layout for all bibliography
 entries.
 You can collect the bibliography of all relevant books and articles of
 your working field in a database.
 This database can be used for different documents, and by default only
 the entries cited in a particular document will appear in the bibliography
 list for that document.
 This relieves you of the need to keep track of which articles and books
 you have cited.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The database is a text file with the file extension 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
.bib
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, containing the bibliography in a special format.
 The format is explained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "BibTeX-2"

\end_inset

 and in LaTeX books (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Mittelbach,Kopka,Lamport"

\end_inset

).
 The file can be created using any text editor, but normally one uses a
 special program to create and edit the entries in the database.
 A list of such programs is maintained on the LyX Wiki at

 Your LaTeX distribution should provide several of these, and many publishers

 layout.
 It is of course possible to write your own style file, but this is something
 for experts.

In our case we want to have

\end_inset

maison
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 after 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

maïs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and write therefore for the index entry of maison:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
maïs@maison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The previous entry need not be a real existing entry.
 You can also use another word to tell LaTeX the entry order.
 See the next subsection for an example.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset VSpace bigskip

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases the index entry order is not correct when you are using the

\family default
to generate the index (see sec.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

).
 
\family sans
makeindex

 would for example print the index entry for the LaTeX-package aeguill in
 sec.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 after the index entries of the other LaTeX-packages although all these
 index commands start with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold
LaTeX-packages !
\series default
 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The reason is that the index entry for aeguill is in a footnote.
 To fix this 
\family sans
makeindex
\family default
 bug, add these commands to the preamble of your document:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
let
\backslash

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 You can also format the page number using the character 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 followed by a LaTeX-command without a backslash.
 We can write for example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to get the page number in italic.
\begin_inset Index idx

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Normally all LaTeX-commands begin with a backslash, but in this special
 case 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 means

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, we encourage you to not format page numbers directly as shown
 above.
 Instead, you should define a macro in the preamble and use that.
 Maybe you want all page references italic that refer to a definition of
 the indexed term, so that users can easily find definitions.
 If so, put the following in the preamble
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
newcommand{
\backslash
IndexDef}[1]{
\backslash
textit{#1}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
my entry|IndexDef
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in the index entry.
\begin_inset Index idx
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Dummy entries ! my entry|IndexDef
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The advantage is that, if you change your mind later or if your publisher
 insists that definitions must not be italic but bold, you just need to
 change the macro in the preamble, not every single index entry.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also change the layout for the whole index.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\family sans
Makeindex
\family default
 is very old, no longer under development and has many pitfalls, notably
 that it was developed with only the English language in mind.
 So it fails to sort anything other than a monolingual English text correctly.
 We have shown above how to fix this sorting.
 However, if you are writing in another than the English language, consider
 to use 
\family sans

Multiple Indexes

In many fields it is common to have more than one index.
 For instance, you might need to set up a separate

 LaTeX does not provide this possibility out of the box, but there are packages
 that add this feature.

\begin_layout Standard
As LyX uses LaTeX in the background, it supports many LaTeX commands and
 constructs, but not all.
 LaTeX contains hundreds of packages that provide different commands.
 All the time packages are being updated and new ones added.
 This has the advantage that you can typeset nearly everything as there
 is for every problem a LaTeX-package.
 But LyX can of course not be up to date and support all packages and their
 commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But don't worry, you can use any LaTeX-command directly in LyX inside the
 TeX Code box.
 A TeX Code box is created by the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
TeX
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Code
\family default
 or by the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "ert-insert"
\end_inset

 (shortcut 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "ert-insert"
\end_inset

).
 The box can be opened by left-clicking and closed by right-clicking on
 it and selecting 
\family sans
Close Inset
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can insert complete or incomplete commands as TeX Code.
 Incomplete means that the command argument can be Standard LyX text.
 For example, if you want to draw a frame around a word and are therefore
 using the LaTeX-command 
\series bold

\backslash
fbox
\series default
, you can write the command part 
\series bold

\backslash
fbox{
\series default
 in a TeX Code box before the word and the closing brace 
\series bold
}
\series default
 in a second TeX Code box behind the word.
 The word between the two TeX Code boxes is then the argument as it is in
 the following example:

When you write larger documents or books, you will need to know something
 about the LaTeX-commands that LyX uses in the background.
 Because LaTeX is based on commands, you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

program
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 your text.
 This has the advantage that the layout of the document can be changed at
 any time if you know the right commands.
 E.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

imagine you have to write a manual for a product and the deadline is the
 end of the day.
 Your boss has just complimented you for your good work but wants to have
 all caption labels bold.
 But you have over a hundred figure and table captions with non-bold labels
 in your manual.
 Of course it is impossible to change all caption labels manually in one
 day.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now LaTeX comes into play.
 As mentioned above, for every problem there exists a LaTeX-package.
 First you have to find out which and therefore look into the LaTeX package
 database, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Catalogue"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As result you find that the package 
\series bold
caption
\series default

\begin_inset Index idx
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX-packages ! caption
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is what you need.
 To use a package, you have to load it in the document preamble (menu 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
) with the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
usepackage[options]{package name}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All LaTeX commands begin with a backslash, the command argument is set within
 two braces and the options are set within two brackets.
 Note that not all commands have an argument and options.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In your case the package name is 
\series bold
caption
\series default
.
 After a look in the documentation of the package, you know that the option
 
\series bold
labelfont=bf
\series default
 will change the font of all caption labels to bold.
 So you add the command
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
usepackage[labelfont=bf]{caption}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
to the preamble and the problem is solved.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For more commands provided by the 
\series bold
caption
\series default
 package, have a look at its documentation, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "caption"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that some document classes have built-in solutions for well-known problems
 like your case.
 For example if you use a 
\family sans
KOMA-Script
\family default
 class, you don't need the package 
\series bold
caption
\series default
, you can instead write
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold

\backslash
setkomafont{captionlabel}{
\backslash
bfseries}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in the preamble and the problem is solved.
 So if you plan to write a large document, you should have a look at the
 documentation of the document class you want to use.
 (
\series bold

\backslash
setkomafont
\series default
 is an example of a command with more than one argument.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commands in the preamble affect the whole document, while commands in the
 text affect only the text after the command or only the text used as command
 argument.
 To insert a LaTeX-command in text, use the TeX Code box as described in
 the previous section.

\begin_layout Standard
In case you need more than one text line as a header/footer, you can do
 this by adding a normal line break in the style definition.
 However, the default height of the header/footer is only the one of one
 text line.
 To expand the height, redefine the LaTeX length 
\series bold

\series default
 or 
\series bold

 in this scheme in your document preamble:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where height is a size in standard units.
 If you don't know which amount of space is needed for the height, define
 your header/footer and preview your document as PDF.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LaTeX-packages ! preview-latex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 If it is not already installed, you will find it in the TeX-catalogue,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 or in the package manager of your LaTeX-system.
 You obtain prettier results if you install the program 
\family typewriter

Selected document parts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides math there are other cases where you might like to see a preview,
 for example things that LyX cannot render like rotated parts or things
 that are not yet supported by LyX.
 To do this, insert a preview inset via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Preview
\family default
.
 Insert or paste the stuff that you want to preview into this inset.
 The preview will be generated when the cursor is outside the preview inset.
 If you click on the preview, you can edit the previewed stuff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An example: To create rotated boxes, you use the LaTeX command 
\series bold

\backslash
rotatebox
\series default
 which is not yet supported by LyX.
\begin_inset Foot

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Instead of the TeX Code boxes you want to see in LyX the final rotated
 boxes, for example to adjust the rotation angle to fit with the surrounding
 text.
 Therefore you create a preview inset and copy the text with the rotated
 boxes into it.
 Here is the result:

If LyX does not show a preview, make sure that you enabled previews as described
 above and also make sure that TeX Code in the preview inset is valid and
 that you loaded the LaTeX packages in your document preamble that are required
 by the TeX Code.
 If LyX cannot create a preview, you will in most cases also not be able
 to view your document due to LaTeX errors.
 So if you have to use some TeX Code and don't know if it is correct, the
 preview inset is a nice method to check it without the need to view the
 whole document.

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advanced find and replace feature of LyX allows for searching of complex,
 format-sensitive text segments and mathematics contents within LyX documents.
 It is an enhancement of the standard (quick) find and replace feature.
 The key-features are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Both searching of text and of mathematical formulas is allowed, where the
 latter is done by entering mathematics in the usual way; not only entire
 mathematical formulas are found, but also parts occurring within more complex
 formulas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search may be format-insensitive, so that the searched text is found in
 any context/style (standard text, section headings, notes, and even mathematics
), or it may be format-sensitive, so that, for example, a word entered with
 a section heading will only be found within section headings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Search may be widened to a specific 
\emph on
scope
\emph default
, i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

a set of files which may be all the children of the document being edited,
 all the open files, or all the manuals available from the 
\family sans
Help
\family default
 menu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Replace may optionally preserve capitalization, so that the replaced text
 capitalization is adapted to the matching text (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

all lowercase, all uppercase, first letter uppercase followed by lowercase)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The advanced find and replace feature is activated through the menu 
\family sans
Edit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Find & Replace
\noun on
 (
\noun default
Advanced
\noun on
)
\family default
\noun default
 (shortcut 
\begin_inset Info

arg   "dialog-show findreplaceadv"
\end_inset

) or the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "dialog-toggle findreplaceadv"
\end_inset

.
 This opens the 
\family sans
Advanced Find and Replace
\family default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Searching for text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enter into the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 LyX mini-editor a simple word, and search for occurrences of it by clicking
 on the 
\family sans
Find Next
\family default
 button at the bottom of the dialog (or just press the 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "break-paragraph"
\end_inset

 key).
 The entered word is found both in text mode and in math mode, and in emphasized
, bold or normal face, and in both in section titles and in standard text.
 Pressing repeatedly 
\begin_inset Info
type  "shortcut"
arg   "break-paragraph"
\end_inset

 keeps searching forward while pressing 
\family sans
Shift+Return
\family default
 searches backwards.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Case sensitive
\family default
 option allows matches to occur only with the same case as entered in the
 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor.
 The 
\family sans
Whole words
\family default
 option allows matches to occur only at word boundaries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Searching for mathematics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mathematical formulas may be searched for by typing them in the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

 or also something more complex like 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x^{2}}{1+x^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 When searching for a formula, it is found both when it is alone and when
 it occurs in sub-formulas and nested parts of sub-formulas.
 For example the mentioned segments would be found in something like 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{x^{2}}{\sqrt{\frac{x^{2}}{1+x^{2}}}}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Style-aware search
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is also possible to search for text with specific styles.
 This is done by switching to the 
\family sans
Settings
\family default
 tab of the dialog and unchecking the 
\family sans
Ignore format
\family default
 option.
 This way, entering in the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a plain word and searching for it would not find instances of the word occurring
 in emphasized or boldface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
an emphasized or boldface word and searching for it would find the respective
 instances with same face only, and within the same text style only.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a plain word in a section heading, and searching for it, finds occurrences
 of if only within section headings.
 Also, if the text to search is given an emphasized or bold face, in addition
 to a section style, then it is found only when occurring with the same
 style.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
a displayed formula will only find instances of this formula that are also
 displayed formulas (and not inline formulas).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Replace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The document segments entered in the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor can be replaced with the text segments entered in the 
\family sans
Replace
\family default
\noun on
 
\noun default
editor.
 In order to find the next occurrence and replace it, click on the 
\family sans

\family default
 button or alternatively
\noun on
 
\noun default
press 
\begin_inset Info

 or 
\family sans
Shift+Return
\family default
 while the cursor is in the 
\family sans
Replace
\family default
\noun on
 
\noun default
editor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can replace with full-featured formatted LyX segments.
 Typical scenarios in which to use this capability may be (just to mention
 a few):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
replacing occurrences of a word with a customized formatted version of the
 same word, for example replacing occurrences of a name like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

func()
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with its typewriter version 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
func()
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
performing a notation rework of mathematical symbols, for example replacing
 occurrences of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (you may want to enable the 
\family sans
Whole words
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Case sensitive
\family default
 options and disable the 
\family sans
Ignore format
\family default
 option in the 
\family sans
Settings
\family default
 tab, in order to avoid replacing all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

R
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 letters occurring in normal text), or occurrences of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i,\, j}$
\end_inset

, or occurrences of 
\begin_inset Formula $x[k]$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Advanced usage
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a regular expression (regexp) based searching facility.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A good explanation of regular expressions is given in this Wikipedia entry:
 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
target "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 You can search for regular expression by inserting a regexp inset into
 the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor.
 This is done via the menu 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Insert Regular Expression
\family default
 while the cursor is in the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor.
 Characters entered within regexp insets are matched according to the regular
 expression matching rules
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Under the constraint that any (sub)expression must match a well-formed LyX
 segment, i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

when matching LaTeX code, no segments with unbalanced {} braces are allowed
 to match expressions.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, while text entered outside regexp insets is matched exactly against the
 same text in the document.
 It is allowed to cut and paste regexp-mode insets as usual.
 Examples of using such a feature may be:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Searching for all fractions with a given denominator: for example, entering
 in the 
\family sans
Find
\family default
 editor the fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{.*}{1+x^{2}}$
\end_inset

 (where the 
\begin_inset Formula $.*$
\end_inset

 on the numerator is the match-everything regular expression) finds all
 fractions with the given denominator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Searching for all text with a given style: for example, after unchecking
 the 
\family sans
Ignore format
\family default
 option from the 
\family sans
Settings
\family default
 tab, entering a 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $.*$
\end_inset


\series default
 regular expression and adding for it an emphasized or bold face, finds
 all emphasized and bold face text, respectively.
 Also, inserting a 
\begin_inset Formula $.*$
\end_inset

 regular expression in a bullet or enumerated list or a section heading,
 you can find all bullet or enumerated lists or section headings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, references to (sub)expressions in regexp may be used as usual:
 Enclosing parts of the expression within round braces 
\begin_inset Formula $()$
\end_inset

, and referring back to them through 
\begin_inset Formula $\backslash1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\backslash2$
\end_inset

, etc..
 For example, try searching for the regexp
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

[[:space:]]([[:alpha:]]+)[[:space:]]
\backslash
1[[:space:]]
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

in order to find word repetitions, if there are any.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The usage of back references in the replaced text is not (yet) implemented.

 starts the spell checking from either the current cursor position or the
 beginning of the currently selected text.
 A sidebar will appear showing any incorrect (or unknown) word found, allowing
 you to edit and replace it in a second line.
 Whenever an unknown word is found, the word is highlighted and the text
 scrolled so that it is visible.
 In the spellchecker sidebar, there is a box showing suggestions for a correctio
n, if any could be found.
 Clicking on one of the corrections will copy it to the 
\family sans
Replacement
\family default
 field, double-click directly invokes the replacement.
 Unknown but correctly typed words can be added to the personal dictionary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the dictionary file used is determined by the document language
 that is set in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
 You can specify the language of a word in the spellchecker dialog by choosing
 a different one at the top of the dialog.
 LyX can correctly spell check documents containing multiple languages.
 This works if you have marked the different languages appropriately and
 have the spell checker dictionaries installed.
 LyX automatically switches to the appropriate dictionary file.

 Therefore, LyX can directly access OpenOffice thesaurus dictionaries, which
 are available for many languages.

Setting up the thesaurus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

OpenOffice thesauri consist of two files per language: A file with the suffix
 
\emph on
*.dat
\emph default
 containing the data and an index file with the suffix 
\emph on
*.idx
\emph default
.
 The standardized file names include the language code for the given language
 (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 en_EN for English).
 For instance, the English files are named:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
th_en_EN_v2.idx
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
th_en_EN_v2.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have LibreOffice or OpenOffice and its thesaurus installed, these
 files should be already on your system.
 If not, you can get dictionaries either from 
\begin_inset Flex URL

 or from the site

\end_inset

\begin_inset Flex URL
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 are usually packed in extension archives (
\emph on
*.oxt
\emph default
) that contain other files such as spellchecker dictionaries besides the
 thesauri.
 These archives are simple zip files, so you can unpack them as you would
 unpack a zip archive.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Put the 
\emph on
*.idx
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
*.dat
\emph default
 files of all languages you want to use into one directory (do not use subfolder
s), and specify the path to this directory in 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Preferences\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Paths
\family default
.
 Now the thesaurus should be ready to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using the thesaurus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start the thesaurus, use the menu 
\family sans
Tools\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Thesaurus
\family default
 or the toolbar button 
\begin_inset Info
type  "icon"
arg   "thesaurus-entry"
\end_inset

 while the cursor is at the word you want to look up or while a word is
 selected.
 A dialog pops up showing you probably related words that you can use as
 a replacement.
 The proposals are grouped into categories.
 Note that, for some languages (such as English), the thesaurus does not
 only show equivalent words (synonyms), but also generic terms (such as
 
\emph on
organism
\emph default
 for 
\emph on
plant
\emph default
), related terms (such as 
\emph on
political
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

theory
\emph default
 for 
\emph on
anarchistic
\emph default
), compounds (such as 
\emph on
tree
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

diagram
\emph default
, if you look for 
\emph on
tree
\emph default
) and opposites (antonyms) (such as 
\emph on
girl
\emph default
 for 
\emph on
boy
\emph default
).
 Generic terms, related terms and antonyms are marked as such.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The language is automatically chosen from the language at the cursor, but
 you can also switch it in the dialog, as you can enter new words to look
 up directly there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the thesaurus cannot handle phrases (only compounds that are in
 the dictionary, such as the above 
\emph on
tree diagram
\emph default
), and you have to use the so called lemma form, i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

the form that is used in the dictionaries (for many languages: first person
 singular indicative active for nouns, infinitive for verbs).
 For example looking up the word forms 
\emph on
reports
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
reporting
\emph default
 yields no results, while results are shown for the word form 
\emph on
report
\emph default
.
 Your best bet is to highlight only the relevant parts of such word (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset


\emph on
report
\emph default
 in 
\emph on
report
\emph default
s), then you get proposals without adjusting the query in the dialog, and
 also the replacement will probably be correct (as only the highlighted
 part will be replaced, thus the ending remains).

The review toolbar helps you to accept, reject, or merge changes – highlight
 the change and press one of the desired toolbar buttons.
 When you merge changes, a window pops up showing you information about
 the next change after the current cursor position.

 Within the merge window you can decide to accept or reject changes and
 step to the next change.
 This way you can jump through all the changes in the document.

 You can save your document settings as default with the
\family sans

\family default
 button in the dialog.
 This will create a template named 
\family typewriter

\family default
 which is automatically loaded by LyX when you create a new document without
 using a template.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The button 
\family sans
Use Class Defaults
\family default
 resets the document settings to the default of the document class.
 This affects mostly class options, the page layout and Numbering & TOC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The different submenus of the dialog are explained in the following sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Document Class
\end_layout

 you can load you own layout-file, that is not in LyX's

 For more about layout-files, see the chapter 
\emph on

 of the

 Handbook.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some classes use special class options by default.
 If this is the case, they are listed in the field 
\family sans
Predefined
\family default
 and you can decide to use them or not.
 If you do not exactly know what the default class options are for, it is
 recommended to leave them untouched.
 The 
\family sans
Graphics driver
\family default
 is used for LaTeX's graphics, color and page layout packages.
 If using 
\family sans
Default
\family default
, the default driver for the LaTeX-packages is used.
 It is recommended that you use the default unless you know what you are
 doing.

\begin_layout Standard
Specifying a master document is necessary if the current document is a child
 or subdocument.
 The master document will be used by LyX in the background if the child
 document is opened without its master.
 This way child documents are always compilable.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The document language and quote styles are set here.
 The encoding specifies how the document content is exported to LaTeX (the
 LyX file is always encoded in utf8).
 All characters that cannot be encoded using the specified encoding will
 be exported as LaTeX-commands (this can fail if a LaTeX-command is not
 known for a particular character).
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The known commands are defined in a text file (
\emph on
unicodesymbols
\emph default
).
 You can add commands for unknown symbols to that file yourself, see the
 
\emph on
Customization
\emph default
 manual for details.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you use the option 
\family sans
Language Default
\family default
, LyX determines the encoding of a text part from the language of this text.
 If the document contains text in more than one language you may get more
 than one encoding in the LaTeX file.
 If you do not use this option then the complete document will always use
 exactly one encoding.
 Checking this option is the preferred setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX also supports Unicode output, which is particularly useful if you need
 lots of special symbols or non-alphabetic scripts, respectively.
 If you want to use this (and your LaTeX installation supports Unicode),
 choose one of the four utf8 variants from the list below.
 Unfortunately the Unicode support of standard LaTeX is quite incomplete,
 so it is not uncommon that a file with lots of Unicode symbols works fine
 with 
\family sans
Language Default
\family default
 (when LyX uses its list of known LaTeX-commands), but does not work with
 a fixed utf8 encoding (when the list of known LaTeX-commands is not used,
 because all Unicode symbols can be encoded in utf8).
 The situation is much better with XeTeX and LuaTeX, two new alternative
 engines to standard LaTeX.
 Both engines support Unicode natively.
 LyX now also supports these two engines (via the output formats

 So if you are using many special or accented characters and

 fails, you might try out one of these new engines.

\begin_layout Standard
To add new or modify existing keybindings to your own taste you can use
 the table in the dialog that lists all LyX-functions and the bound shortcuts.
 To find functions easily, they are grouped by categories and the dialog
 provides the field 
\family sans
Show key-bindings containing
\family default
.
 In this field you can insert a keyword for a function you want to edit.
 Insert there for example as keyword 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paste
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and you get the 4 different existing shortcuts for the 3 different functions
 that contain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paste
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in their name.
 As you can see, one function can have more than one shortcut.
 All LyX-functions are also listed in the file

, select the function and press the 
\family sans
Modify

 button.
 A dialog pops up where you can add the shortcut by using it.
 So press Alt+Q to define the shortcut.
 Modifying an existing shortcut is done the same way.
 You can also bind multiple functions to one shortcut by modifying an existing
 binding and adding the different function names as a semicolon separated
 list.
 LyX will then use the first function that is enabled in the current document
 part.
 The binding for the function 
\family sans
command-alter
\family default
 is an example of this.
\end_layout

Alternatively you can also edit shortcuts by modifying bind-files with a
 text editor.

\begin_layout Description
PATH
\begin_inset space ~

 When LyX needs to use an external program, it looks in this list where
 to find it on the system.
 The path list is automatically set up on Windows and Mac systems when LyX
 is configured, so that you normally don't have to modify it.
 On Unix
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}

 programs you wish to use that are not in your normal system path ($PATH).

\begin_layout Description
TEXINPUTS
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

prefix The TEXINPUTS environment variable allows to use external files which
 are included to a LyX document via commands in TeX code or in the document
 preamble.
 This prefix includes by default the document directory (represented by
 a single dot '.').
 The prefix can contain any list of paths separated by the default separator
 of the OS (':' on UNIX like systems and ';' on Windows).
 If files are included, the paths listed in the TEXINPUTS prefix will be
 scanned for the input files.
 Note that any non-absolute path listed in the TEXINPUTS prefix is considered
 to be relative to the directory of your LyX file.
 It is recommended to include always '.' as one of the paths, otherwise compilati
on may fail for some documents.
