Introduction

\begin_layout Section
What is LyX?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX is a document preparation system.
 It is a tool for producing beautiful manuscripts, publishable books, business
 letters and proposals, and even poetry.
 It is unlike most other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word processors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that it uses the paradigm of a markup language as its core
 editing style.
 That means that when you type a section header, you mark it as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bold, 17 pt type, left justified, 5 mm space below
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 LyX takes care of the typesetting for you, so you deal only with concepts,
 not the mechanics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This philosophy is explained in much greater detail in the 
\emph on

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Introduction
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\emph default
.
 If you haven't read it yet, you need to.
 Yes, we mean now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Introduction
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 describes several things in addition to LyX's philosophy: most importantly,
 the format of all of the manuals.
 If you don't read it, you'll have a bear of a time navigating this manual.
 You might also be better served looking in one of the other manuals instead
 of this one.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\emph on
Introduction
\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 describes that, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Getting Started
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Invoking LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to other Linux [and other brands of Unix] programs, you start LyX
 by simply typing 
\family typewriter
lyx
\family default
 at the command line.
 You can, of course, include several command-line options, including file
 names.
 We're not going to repeat all of the command-line options here, since we've
 already done that in the 
\family typewriter
man
\family default
 page for LyX.
 Check there for more info.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are one or two things we'd like to comment on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please note that if you include more than one file name on the command line,
 LyX will load them all, though it won't display them all simultaneously.
 More on that in a bit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How LyX Looks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like most applications, LyX has the familiar menu bar across the top of
 its window.
 Below it is a toolbar with a pulldown box and various buttons.
 There is, of course, a vertical scrollbar and a main work area for editing
 documents.
 Near the bottom of the window is a small window containing a single line
 of text.
 This is the 
\emph on
minibuffer
\emph default
 (a term which we've swiped, lock, stock, and barrel, from GNU Emacs), which
 really means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

command buffer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Type 
\family sans
M-x
\family default
 when you need to type a command in the minibuffer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that there is no horizontal scroll bar.
 This is not a bug or an oversight, but intentional.
 When you read a book, you expect the end of a line to wrap around to the
 next line.
 Text overflows onto new pages in a vertical fashion, hence the need for
 only a vertical scrollbar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three cases where you might want a horizontal scrollbar.
 The first case is large figures, displayed WYSIWYG\SpecialChar \@.
 This, however, is due
 to a flaw in the routine that displays graphics on the LyX screen in a
 WYSIWYG fashion; it should rescale the graphics to fit in the window, just
 as you'd need to rescale graphics to fit on a page.
 The second and third cases are tables and equations which are wider than
 the LyX window.
 You can use the arrow keys to scroll horizontally through the table, but
 this doesn't work for equations yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
HELP!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the bad news: the help system is not as thorough as that in many
 commercial applications.
 Patience.
 We're working on it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the good news: the help system consists of the LyX manuals.
 You can read 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of the manuals from inside LyX.
 Just select the manual you want read from the 
\family sans
\bar under
H
\bar default
elp
\family default
 menu.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While we're at it, we'd like to make a comment about the manuals.
 They're not idiot-proof, not in the least.
 Here's what one of our authors, 
\noun on
John Weiss
\noun default
, once said about manuals:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I hate manuals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Yes, we've all dealt with the terse, poorly-translated, or cryptic manuals.
 They are aggravating.
 I find, however, that the overly simplified ones are even more aggravating.
 First, they spend about half their time carefully explaining to the user
 how to operate a mouse, what a menu is, et cetera, ad nauseum.
 Please, if someone doesn't know how to use their own computer, or a GUI,
 then they should sit down and learn 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 they start up a major piece of software.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Second, what information they do provide seems to assume that the user is
 stupid.
 Utter nonsense! Most users, in my experience, are some combination of clueless
 and intimidated, not stupid.
 Besides, if someone is truly slow on the uptake, they need help that a
 manual for a piece of computer software can't give.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Editor's Note: With this in mind, I've instructed all of the other authors
 to avoid patronizing you, the reader, and to be more pedagogical than pedantic.
 As for those who are too lazy to read and understand the manuals --- well,
 as we say here in America, there's no such thing as a free lunch.

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic File Operations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the 
\family sans
\bar under

 menu are the 9 basic operations for any word processor in addition to some
 more advanced operations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\bar default
rint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
E
\bar under
x
\bar default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
They all do pretty much the same thing as in other word processors, with
 a few minor differences.
 The 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New\InsetSpace ~
from
\bar under
\InsetSpace ~
T
\bar default
emplate
\family default
 command not only prompts you for a name for the new file, but also prompts
 you for a template to use.
 Selecting a template will automatically set certain layout features for
 the document, features you would otherwise need to change manually.
 They can be of use for certain classes, especially those for writing letters
 [see sec.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:doc-classes}

\end_inset

]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: There is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

default file
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or document named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Untitled
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

scratch.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Unless you tell LyX to open a file or create a new one, that big, blank
 space is just that --- a big, blank space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
\bar under
R
\bar default
evert
\family default
 command is useful if more people work on the same document at the same
 time

\begin_layout Standard
If you plan to do this, you should check out the Version Control feature
 in LyX also.
 Read

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 It will simply reload the document from disk.
 You can of course also use it if you regret that you changed a document
 and want to restore it to the last save.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second matter of note concerns the commands 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
C
\bar default
lose
\family default
 and 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator
E
\bar under
x
\bar default
it
\family default
.
 They both feature a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nag box
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to save us all from our own stupidity.
 That is, if you try to close a file with changes [or exit LyX], you'll
 be informed that there are unsaved files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic Editing Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like most modern word processors, LyX can perform cut and paste operations
 on blocks of text, can move by character, word, or screenful of text, and
 can delete whole words as well as individual characters.
 The next four sections cover the basic LyX editing features and how to
 access them.
 We'll start with cut and paste.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you might expect, the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit
\family default
 menu has the cut and paste commands, along with various other editing features.
 Some of these are special and covered in later sections.
 The basic ones are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Cut
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Copy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
Paste
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
ind\InsetSpace ~
&\InsetSpace ~
Replace\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first three are self-explanatory.
 One thing to note: whenever you delete a block of text that you've selected,
 it's automatically placed in the clipboard.
 That is, the 
\family sans
Delete
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Backspace
\family default
 keys also functions as the 
\family sans
Cut
\family default
 command.
 Also, if you've selected text, be careful.
 If you hit a key, LyX will completely delete the selected text and replace
 it with what you just typed.
 You'll have to do an 
\family sans
\bar under
U
\bar default
ndo
\family default
 to get back the lost text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
F
\bar default
ind\InsetSpace ~
&\InsetSpace ~
Replace\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default
 item opens the 
\family sans
Find\InsetSpace ~
&\InsetSpace ~
Replace
\family default
 dialog.
 The text you want to find goes in the 
\family sans
Fi
\bar under
n
\bar default
d
\family default
 box.
 Once you've found a word or expression, LyX selects it.
 Hitting the 
\family sans
\bar under
R
\bar default
eplace
\family default
 button replaces the selected text with the contents of the 
\family sans
Replace\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
w
\bar default
ith
\family default
 box.
 You can click to search again to skip the current word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hit 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans

\begin_layout Standard

 I.e., searching for

, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Undo and Redo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you make a mistake, you can easily recover from it.
 LyX has a large-capacity undo/redo buffer.
 Select 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
U
\bar default
ndo
\family default
 to undo some mistake.
 If you accidently undo too much, use 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R
\bar default
edo
\family default
 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

undo the undo.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The undo mechanism is currently limited to 100 steps to minimise memory
 overhead.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that if you revert back all changes to arrive to the document as
 it was last saved, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

changed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 status of the document is unfortunately not reset.
 This is a consequence of the 100 step undo limit, above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
\bar under
U
\bar default
ndo
\family default
 and 
\family sans
\bar under
R
\bar default
edo
\family default
 work on almost everything in LyX.
 They have some quirks, too.
 They won't 
\family sans
\bar under
U
\bar default
ndo
\family default
 or 
\family sans
\bar under
R
\bar default
edo
\family default
 text character by character, but by blocks of text.
 That can take some getting used to; you'll have to play with 
\family sans
\bar under
U
\bar default
ndo
\family default
 and 
\family sans
\bar under
R
\bar default
edo
\family default
 to get a feel for just how much they'll undo/redo, and after time, you'll
 hopefully appreciate how it works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Basic Mouse Bindings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're not going to go into all of the mouse bindings here.
 Some of the other sections of this manual cover specific operations you

 Instead, we're going to cover the most basic mouse operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

Basic Key Bindings
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec: key bindings}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again, we're not going to cover all of the keybindings.
 Be aware that there are at least two different primary binding maps: CUA
 and Emacs.
 I guarantee you will cuss when you press Control-d to delete a character,
 and it starts up a DVI previewer instead (or vice versa).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some keys, like 
\family sans

 Other keys don't:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

 There is no such thing as a tab stop in LyX.
 If you don't understand this, go read Sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:parindentintro}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:par-environments}

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family sans
Esc
\family default
 This is the

\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family sans
Home
\family default
\InsetSpace ~
and\InsetSpace ~

\family sans

 These move the cursor, respectively, to the beginning and end of a line,
 unless you are using the Emacs bindings where they jump to the beginning
 or end of the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family sans

 you have your keyboard set up correctly under the X Windows System, 
\family sans
Backspace

 deletes the character under the cursor [if no text is selected].
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If you haven't set up your keyboard under X, or have no idea what we mean
 by that, go read section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:x-win-keys}

 immediately.
 You'll save yourself a lot of headaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there are the modifier keys:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

 This has a couple of different uses, depending on which keys it's used
 in combination with:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
With 
\family sans
Backspace
\family default
 or 
\family sans

, it deletes an entire word instead of a single character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With 
\family sans
Left

, it moves by words instead of characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With 
\family sans

\family default
, it moves to the beginning and the end of the document, respectively.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family sans
Shift-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring 00.00.0000

\family sans
Meta-
\family default
 This is the Alt key on many keyboards, unless your keyboard has a distinct
 Meta key.
 Unfortunately, X sometimes has their functionality swapped, so if you have
 both keys, you will need to do a little trial and error to find out which
 one actually performs the 
\family sans
Meta-
\family default
 function.
 This key does many different things, but it also activates the 
\emph on
menu accelerator keys
\emph default
.
 If you use this in combination with any of the underlined letters in a
 menu or menu item, it selects that menu item.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

Hopefully, you'll learn more and more keybindings and short-cut keys as
 you use LyX, because most mouse actions will prompt a small message in

\begin_layout Section
Basic LyX Setup
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:setup}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two ways to run LyX.
 The first way is to install LyX and all of its support files on your system.
 Of course, you need root (administrator) privileges to do that.
 The second way to run LyX doesn't require root access, letting you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

install
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 LyX somewhere in your own account.
 LyX will automatically detect where it is as long as the supporting directories
 are put in the correct places.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several features of LyX that can be configured from inside LyX,
 without resorting to configuration files.
 First, LyX is able to inspect your system to see what programs, LaTeX document
 classes and LaTeX packages are available.
 It uses this knowledge to give reasonable defaults to several 
\family typewriter
preferences
\family sans
 
\family default
variables.
 Although this configuration has already been done when LyX was installed
 on your system, you might have some items that you installed locally and
 which are not seen by LyX.
 To force LyX to re-inspect your system, you should use 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
R
\bar default
econfigure
\family default
.
 You should then restart LyX to ensure that the changes are taken into account.
 As far as LaTeX classes and packages are concerned, you will find information
 about what has been found under 
\family sans
\bar under
H
\bar default
elp\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
L
\bar default
aTeX\InsetSpace ~
Configuration
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second set of settings that you might want to change comprises all the
 document-level setting that you can change via the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
 To do this, open a scrap document, set all these options according to your
 taste and save them with the 
\family sans
\bar under
S
\bar default
ave\InsetSpace ~
as\InsetSpace ~
Document\InsetSpace ~
Defaults
\family default
 button in the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument
\family default
 dialog.
 This will create a template named 
\family typewriter
default.lyx
\family default
 which is automatically loaded by LyX when you open a document without template
 such that the settings are automatically set-up as you defined them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are many other user-configurable options that you can feed to LyX.
 Upon startup, LyX reads a global options file called 
\family typewriter
lyxrc.defaults
\family default
.
 It will then attempt to read a file called 
\family typewriter
preferences

\begin_layout Subsection
Modifiers and Mode_switch
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX supports three modifiers: Shift [
\family sans
S-
\family default
], Control [
\family sans
C-
\family default
], and Meta [
\family sans
M-
\family default
].
 Moreover, if one of the keys of your keyboard is configured as a 
\family sans
Compose
\family default
 key, then you can use it to enter some characters not available on your
 keyboard.
 This compose key can be used either as a modifier (like 
\family sans
Shift
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Control
\family default
) or as a prefix key.
 Here are some examples of what you can do with a 
\family sans
Compose
\family default
 key:
\end_layout

Helpful Hints and Tips
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, open up two xterminals.
 Use one to edit a new 
\family typewriter
.Xmodmap
\family default
 file and run 
\family typewriter
xkeycaps
\family default
 from the other.
 Using 
\family typewriter
xkeycaps
\family default
, remap your keyboard the way you want it.
 There's a button in 
\family typewriter
xkeycaps
\family default
 to output the new keymap.
 Once you hit it, 
\family typewriter
xkeycaps
\family default
 will spit a bunch of stuff on the xterm you executed it from.
 Just copy and paste all of that into your 
\family typewriter
.Xmodmap
\family default
 file, and you're done.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
You could also save yourself some typing by executing 
\family typewriter
xkeycaps > .Xmodmap
\family default
.
 This will create a usable map file.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, there are some things you can do to help you get oriented.
 Try executing the command 
\family typewriter
xmodmap -v -pm
\family default
.
 This will show you all of the currently active modifiers.
 Also try 
\family typewriter
xmodmap -v -pke | more 
\family default
to see which keycode numbers are mapped to which symbolic names.
 It will also give you some idea of the syntax of the 
\family typewriter
.Xmodmap
\family default
 file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's one thing you'll need to check.
 Make sure that your 
\family sans
Delete
\family default
 and 
\family sans
BackSpace
\family default
 keys are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 defined as the same key symbol by X! Note that giving these two keys unique
 symbol names will not necessarily alter the behavior of your programs.
 Some programs bind 
\family sans
Delete
\family default
 and 
\family sans
BackSpace
\family default
 to the same operation.
 Emacs is one.
 Other programs, however, use 
\family sans
Delete
\family default
 and 
\family sans
BackSpace
\family default
 for different operations.
 LyX is one of these programs, and if you have 
\family sans
Delete
\family default
 and 
\family sans
BackSpace
\family default
 labeled with the same key symbol name, you'll have trouble using LyX.

 If you don't know what a DVI file is, you've probably also never worked
 with LaTeX and should read the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 document before proceeding further.
 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 converts DVI files into PostScript, which is the format most printers use
 nowadays.
 For those of you using dot-matrix and inkjet printers, you'll want to filter
 the PostScript through 
\family typewriter
ghostscript
\family default
, which is capable of creating output for a variety of printers.
 The following section on printer setup describes how to do this automatically
 every time you print.
 For now, we'll concentrate on

 If it is set up to print to a file, and if no filename is specified, it
 will simply turn 
\family typewriter

 Most systems have

 lying around somewhere.
 Typically, the

 Change it to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
o | lpr -Pfoo
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 However, you should probably investigate the entries

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
D
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

, which define respectively the Metafont mode and the resolution of the
 printer.
 If you do not know what a Metafont mode is, you can see it as a printer
 driver: it adapts the design of TeX fonts to ensure that they give the
 best possible result on your printer.
 Be warned however that, if you define different Metafont modes for different
 printers, 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 will generate several copies of your TeX fonts on disk, and these take
 valuable space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you are satisfied that your printers are correctly configured, you
 should tell LyX to make use of this configuration.
 To do this, you should launch the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your printer doesn't understand PostScript®, you'll need to use 
\family typewriter

\begin_layout Standard
Some people don't seem to like using the

 There is a major disadvantage to this method.
 You can't include any PostScript files, such as graphics, in your documents,
 since the printer-specific conversion programs don't understand PostScript®.
 For that reason, the LyX team highly recommends using 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ghostscript
\family default
 for printing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ghostscript, Xdvi and Ghostview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
Xdvi
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 are viewers.
 The former handles 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 files, while the later interfaces with 
\family typewriter
ghostscript
\family default
 to allow you to view PostScript files.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A quick note on both of these programs.
 Both automatically update themselves if the viewed file
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
That means the 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
.ps
\family default
 file, not the files used to make these.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 changes.
 You can also force an update.
 So, once you've opened one of these two viewers, there's no reason to close
 it.
 Also, both programs are functionally the same, providing all of the same
 features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LyX team recommends using 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
 for fine tuning documents.
 Why? It's faster; there's one less layer of processing you need to do before
 you can view the changes.
 Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
 to preview a document from LyX, and leave it running.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make changes to the document using LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To view those changes, just choose
\family sans
\bar under
 V
\bar default
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
U
\bar default
pdate\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
D
\bar default
VI
\family default
.
 When LaTeX's all done, click on the 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
 window, and voilà! 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
 will update itself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, this doesn't mean 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 is useless.
 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 is better suited to those occasions where you 
\emph on
must
\emph default
 view the PostScript version of the document.
 For repeated changes that aren't PostScript® dependent, you're better off
 previewing with 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
.
 There is an alternative to 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 which sports a much better interface: 
\family typewriter
gv
\family default
.
 LyX will automatically use it instead of 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
 if it is available.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before you do anything else, before you ever start writing a document, you
 need to decide what 
\emph on
type
\emph default
 of document you want to edit.
 Different types of documents use different types of spacing, headings,
 numbering schemes, and so on.
 Additionally, different documents use different paragraph environments,
 and format the title of your document differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\emph on
document class
\emph default
 describes a group of properties common to a particular set of documents.
 By setting the document class, you automagically select these properties,
 making it easier to create the type of document you want.
 If you don't choose a document class, LyX picks one for you by default.
 So, it behooves you to change the class of your document.

The Various Document Classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are five standard document classes in LyX.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Article for basic articles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Report for basic reports
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Book for writing a book
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Letter for US-style letters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Slides is used to make transparencies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are also some non-standard classes, which LyX only uses if you have
 a LaTeX setup that supports them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Aapaper Journal articles in the style and format used in Astronomy & Astrophysic
s
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Amsart Journal articles in the style and format used by the AMS [American
 Mathematical Society].
 There are three amsart layouts available.
 The standard one uses a typical numbering scheme for theorems, 
\emph on
etc.
\emph default
, that prepends the section number to the number of the result.
 All result-type statements (propositions, corollaries, and so on) are sequenced
 together, but definitions, examples, and the like have their own sequence.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sequential numbering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 scheme does not place the section number with each result, but numbers
 them throughout the article in a single sequence.
 Each type of result gets its own sequence.
 There is also a layout that dispenses with numbering of statements altogether.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Amsbook Books in the style and format used by the AMS.
 Only the standard numbering scheme is provided, under the assumption that
 you would not want to number results consecutively throughout a book, and
 that you would need to number results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Dinbrief für Briefe nach deutscher Art
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Foils is used to make transparencies, but is better than 
\family sans
slides
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Linuxdoc Used with the SGML-tools package (formerly known as LinuxDoc).
 It allows LyX to produce SGML output.
 SGML is a markup language and is the predecessor to HTML\SpecialChar \@.
 The SGML-tools
 package allows you to convert SGML to HTML or to the format used by 
\family typewriter
man
\family default
 pages.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Paper for use with the 
\family typewriter
paper
\family default
 LaTeX document class [not in all LaTeX distributions]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Revtex is used to write articles for the publications of the American Physical
 Society (APS), American Institute of Physics (AIP), and Optical Society
 of America (OSA).
 This class is not completely compatible with all LyX features.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We won't go into any detail about how to use these different document classes
 here.
 You can find all the details about the non-standard classes in the 
\emph on
Extended Editing
\emph default
 manual.
 Here, we will settle with a list of some of the common properties of all
 of the document classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Selecting a Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can select a class using the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument
\bar under
\SpecialChar \menuseparator
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
 Select the class you want to use, and make any fine tunings of the options
 you may need.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Properties
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each class has a default set of options.
 Here's a quick table describing them:

Important Note:

\begin_layout Standard
If you change a document's class, LyX has to convert 
\emph on
everything

 into the new class.
 That includes the paragraph environments.
 Some paragraph environments are standard; all of the document classes have
 them.
 Some classes have special paragraph environments, however.
 If this is the case, and you change document classes, LyX sets the missing
 paragraph environments to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 and places an error box at the beginning of the paragraph.
 Just click on them and you'll get a message dialog that tells you about
 the conversion and why it failed.

Paragraph Indentation and Separation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:parindentintro}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before describing all of the various paragraph environments, we'd like to
 say a word or two about paragraph indentation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Everyone seems to have their own convention for separating paragraphs.
 Most Americans indent the first line of a paragraph.
 Others don't indent but put extra space between the paragraphs.
 LyX uses the same convention you find among typographers.
 The 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 paragraph of a section, or after a figure, an equation, a table, a list,
 etc., is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 indented.
 Only a paragraph following another paragraph gets indented.
 Some people don't like this convention, but if you want to use indented
 paragraphs, you'll have to live with it.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
There is a way to force LaTeX to indent all paragraphs.
 LyX won't show this, of course, but LaTeX 
\emph on
will
\emph default
 print it that way.
 You'll need to get a special package and insert an appropriate command
 in the preamble.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The space between paragraphs, like the line spacing, the space between headings
 and text --- in fact, all of the spacings for just about everything are
 pre-coded into LyX.
 As we said, you don't worry about how much space to add between what.
 LyX takes care of that.
 In fact, these pre-coded vertical spacings aren't a single number but a
 range.
 That way, LyX can squish or stretch the space between lines to make sure
 figures fit on a page with text, so that sections don't start at the bottom
 of a page, and so on.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, LaTeX does this when LyX goes to produce a printable file.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 However, pre-coded doesn't mean you can't change them.
 LyX gives you the ability to globally change 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 of these pre-coded spacings.
 We'll explain more later.
\end_layout

 If paragraphs have no indentation but use extra space for separation, this
 button will be completely ignored (you can't indent a single paragraph
 by toggling this).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should only need to change the indentation method for a single paragraph
 if you need to do some fine-tuning.

command sequences in an ordinary LaTeX file.
 If you don't know LaTeX, or the concept of a paragraph environment is totally
 alien to you, we urge you to read the 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
.
 The 
\emph on
Tutorial
\emph default
 also contains many more examples than this section does.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A paragraph environment is simply a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

container
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for a paragraph which gives that paragraph certain properties.
 This can include a particular style of font, different margins, a numbering
 scheme, labels, and so on.
 Additionally, you can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nest
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the different environments inside one another, allowing one environment
 to inherit some of the properties of another.
 The different paragraph environments totally replace the need for messy
 tab stops, on the fly margin adjustment, and other hold-overs from the
 days of typewriters.
 There are several paragraph environments which are specific to a particular
 document type.
 We'll only be covering the most common ones here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To choose a new paragraph environment, use the pull-down box on the left
 end of the toolbar.
 LyX will change the environment of the 
\emph on
entire
\emph default
 paragraph in which the cursor sits.
 You can also change the environment of an entire group of paragraphs if
 you select them before choosing the new environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 will 
\emph on
typically
\emph default
 create a new paragraph using the 
\family sans

 We say

LyX keeps the old paragraph environment when you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, rather than resetting it to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 LyX will still reset the nesting depth, however.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Usually, starting a new paragraph resets both the paragraph environment
 and the nesting depth [more on nesting in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

].
 At the moment, all this is context-specific; you're better off expecting
 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 to reset the paragraph environment and depth.
 If you want a new paragraph to keep the current environment and depth,
 use 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 instead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Standard
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default paragraph environment is 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 for most classes.
 It creates a plain paragraph.
 If LyX resets the paragraph environment, this is the one it chooses.
 In fact, the paragraph you're reading right now [and most of the ones in
 this manual] are in the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can nest a paragraph using the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment in just about anything else, but you can't really nest anything
 in a 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Document Titles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A LaTeX title page has three parts: the title itself, the name[s] of the
 author[s] and a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

footnote
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for thanks or contact information.
 For certain types of documents, LaTeX places all of this on a separate
 page along with today's date.
 For other types of documents, the title 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

page
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 goes at the top of the first page of the document.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX provides an interface to the title page commands through the paragraph
 environments 
\family sans
Title
\family default
, 
\family sans
Author
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Date
\family default
.
 Here's how you use them:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Put the title of your document in the 
\family sans
Title
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Put the author name in the 
\family sans
Author
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you want the date to have a certain appearance, want to use a fixed date,
 or want other text to appear in place of today's date, put that text in
 the 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 environment.
 Note that using this environment is optional.
 If you don't provide any, LaTeX will automatically insert today's date.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Be sure to do this at the top of the document.
 You can use footnotes to insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thanks
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 or contact information.

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX labels each heading with a series of numbers, separated by periods.
 The numbers describe where in the document you are.
 These headings all subdivide your document into different pieces of text.
 For example, suppose you're writing a book.
 You group the book into chapters.
 LyX does similar grouping:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Either 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Section
\family default
 is the maximum sectioning level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Note:
\emph default
 not all document types use the 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 heading as the maximum sectioning level.
 In that case, the 
\family sans
Section
\family default
 is the top-level heading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, if you use the 
\family sans
Subsubsection
\family default
 environment to label a new sub-subsection, LyX labels it with its number,
 along with the number of the subsection, section, and, if applicable, chapter
 that it's in.
 For example: the fifth section of the second chapter of this book has the
 label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

2.5
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Unnumbered Headings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are 3 types of unnumbered section headings.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
Subsection*
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

*
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 after each name means that these headings are not numbered.
 They work the same as their numbered counterparts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Changing the Numbering
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:section-depth}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also alter which sectioning levels get numbered and which ones appear
 in the Table of Contents.
 Now, this doesn't remove any of the levels; that's preset in the document
 class.
 Certain classes start with 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 and go down to the 
\family sans
Subparagraph
\family default
 level.
 Others start at 
\family sans
Section
\family default
.
 Similarly, not all document classes number all sectioning levels.
 Most don't number 
\family sans
Paragraph
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Subparagraph
\family default
.
 This is something you can change.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Open the 
\family sans

\bar default

 You should see a counter labelled 
\family sans
Section\InsetSpace ~
number\InsetSpace ~
depth
\family default
 under the 
\family sans
Extra
\family default
 tab.
 This counter controls how far down in the sectioning hierarchy LyX numbers
 a section heading.
 Unfortunately, the number you choose with the slider is really goofy, so

\begin_layout Subsection
Quotes and Poetry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has three paragraph environments for writing poetry and quotations.
 They are 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
.
 Forget the days of changing linespacing and twiddling with margins.
 These three paragraph environments already have those changes built-in.
 They all widen the left margin and add a bit of extra space above and below
 the text they contain.
 They also allow nesting, so you can put a 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 in a 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, as well as in some other paragraph environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another feature of these three paragraph environments: they do
 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 when you start a new paragraph.
 So, you can type in that poem and merrily hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 without worrying about the paragraph environment changing on you.
 Of course, that means that, once you're done typing in that poem, you have
 to change back to the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Quote
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:quote}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've described the similarities of these three environments, it's
 time for the differences.
 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 are identical except for one difference: 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 uses extra spacing to separate paragraphs and never indents the first line.
 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 
\emph on
always
\emph default
 indents the first line of a paragraph and uses the same line spacing throughout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example of the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
This is in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 I can keep writing, extending this line out further and further until it
 wraps.
 See - no indentation!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Here's the second paragraph of this quote.
 Again, there's no indentation, but there is extra space between me and
 the other paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That ends that example.
 Here's another example, this time in the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
This is in the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 environment.
 If I keep writing, you'll see the indentation.
 If your country uses a writing style that shows off new paragraphs by indenting
 the first line, then 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 is the environment for you! Well, you'd use it 
\emph on
if
\emph default
 you were quoting other text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Here's a new paragraph.
 I could ramble on and on, like a politician at election time.
 If I did that, though, you'd get bored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was our other example.
 As the example notes, 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 is for those people who use extra space to separate paragraphs.
 They should put quotes in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 Those who use indentation to mark a new paragraph should use the 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 paragraph environment for quoted text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Verse
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:verse}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans
Verse
\family default
 is a paragraph environment for poetry, rhymes, verses, and so on.
 Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
This is in Verse
\newline
Which I did not rehearse!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
It could be much worse.
 This line could be long, very long, oh so long, so very long that it wraps
 around.
 It looks okay on screen, but in the printed version, the extra lines are
 indented a bit more than the first.
 Okay, so it's turned to prose and doesn't rhyme anymore.
 So sue me.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Verse
To break a line
\newline
And make things look fine
\newline
Use 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 does not indent both margins.
 Each stanza of the verse or poem is in its own paragraph.
 To separate the individual lines of a stanza, use the 
\family typewriter
break-line
\family default
 function, 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lists
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:parenvlists}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has four different paragraph environments for creating different kinds
 of lists.
 In the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments, LyX labels your list items with bullets or numbers, respectively.
 In the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 and 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environments, LyX lets you provide your own label.
 We'll present the individual details of each type of list next after describing
 some general features of all four of them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
General Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four paragraph environments for lists differ from the other environments
 in several ways.
 First, LyX treats each paragraph as a list item.
 Hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 but keeps the current environment and creates a new list item.
 The nesting depth is typically reset, however.
 If you want to keep both the current nesting depth and paragraph environment,
 you should use 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 to break paragraphs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can nest lists of any type inside one another.
 In fact, LyX changes the labels on some list items depending on how its
 nested.
 If you intend to use any of the list paragraph environments, we suggest
 you read all of section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Itemize
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:itemize}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first type of list we'll describe in detail is the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 paragraph environment.
 It has the following properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Each item has a particular bullet or symbol as its label.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
LyX uses the same symbol for all of the items in a given nesting level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The symbol appears at the beginning of the first line.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The items can be any length.
 LyX automatically offsets the left margin of each item.
 The offset is always relative to whatever environment the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list may be in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you nest an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment inside another 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, the label changes to a new symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
There are four different symbols for up to a four-fold nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX always shows the same symbol, an asterisk, on screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

 for a full explanation of nesting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Of course, that explanation was also an example of an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list.
 The 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment is best suited for lists where the order doesn't matter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We said that different levels use different symbols as their label.
 Here's an example of all four possible symbols.
 Note that those of you reading this manual online won't see any difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the first level 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 is a large black dot, or bullet.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the second level is a dash.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the third is an asterisk.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
The label for the fourth is a centered dot.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back out to the third level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back to the second level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Back to the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These are the default labels for an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list.
 You can customize these labels in the
\begin_inset ERT
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard


\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice how the space between items decreases with increasing depth.
 We'll explain nesting and all the tricks you can do with different depths
 in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

.
 Be sure to read it!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Enumerate
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:enumerate}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment is the tool to use to create numbered lists and outlines.
 It has these properties:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each item has a numeral as its label.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The type of numeral depends on the nesting depth.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
LyX automatically counts the items for you and updates the label as appropriate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Each new 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment resets the counter to one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Like the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Offsets the items relative to the left margin.
 Items can be any length.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Reduces the space between items as the nesting depth increases.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Uses different types of labels depending on the nesting depth.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Allows up to a four-fold nesting.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 
\emph on
does
\emph default
 show the different labels for each item.
 Here is how LyX labels the four different levels in an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The first level of an 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 uses Arabic numerals followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The second level uses lower case letters surrounded by parentheses.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The third level uses lower-case Roman numerals followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The fourth level uses capital letters followed by a period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Again, notice the decrease in the spacing between items as the nesting depth
 increases.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the third level
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the second level.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Back to the outermost level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once again, you can customize the type of numbering used in the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
 It involves adding commands to the LaTeX preamble (see the 
\emph on
Extended Features
\emph default
 manual), however.
 As stated earlier, such customization only shows up in the printed version,
 not on the LyX screen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is more to nesting 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environments than we've stated here.
 You 
\emph on
really
\emph default
 should read section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

 to learn more about nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Description
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:descrlist}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the previous two environments, the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 list has no fixed label.
 Instead, LyX uses the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the first line as the label.
 Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Example: This is an example of the
\family sans
 Description
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX typesets the label in boldface and puts extra space between it and the
 rest of the line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, you're probably wondering what we mean by, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

uses the first 'word'.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 key does not add a whitespace character, but separates words from one another.
 Inside of a 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment, the 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 key tells LyX to end the label if we're at the beginning of the first line
 of an item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, what if you want or need to use more than one word in the label
 of a 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment? Simple: use a 
\family sans
Protected Blank
\family default
.
 [Use either 
\family sans
C-Space
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Special\InsetSpace ~
F
\bar under

Example: This one shows how to use a 
\family sans

\family default

 list item.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Usage: You should use the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment for things like definitions and theorems.
 Use it when you need to make one word in particular stand out in the text
 that describes it.
 It's not a good idea to use a 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment when you have an entire sentence that you want to describe.
 You're better off using 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and nesting several 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 paragraphs into them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Nesting: You can, of course, nest 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environments inside one another, nest them in other types of lists, and
 so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that after the first line, LyX indents subsequent lines, offsetting
 them from the first line.

, you've goofed.
 The 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 create numbered lists.
 That's what 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 does, and it's documented in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:enumerate}

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 environment the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment has user-defined labels for each list item.
 There are some key differences between this list environment and the other
 three:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMM
item\InsetSpace ~
labels LyX uses the first 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of each line as the item label.
 The first 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 after the beginning of the first line of an item marks the end of the label.
 If you need to use more than one word in an item label, use a protected
 blank as described above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMM
margins As you can see, LyX uses different margins for the item label and
 the body of the item text.
 The body of the text has a larger left margin, which is equal to the default
 label width plus a little extra space.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMM
label\InsetSpace ~
width LyX uses one of two things for the label width: the actual width
 of the label, or the default width, whichever is larger.
 If the actual width is larger, then the label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extends
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 into the first line.
 In other words, the text of the first line isn't aligned with the left
 margin of the rest of the item text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMM
default\InsetSpace ~
width You can very easily set this default width.
 It's quite painless, actually.
 So, you can easily ensure that the text of all items in a 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment have the same left margin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMM
uses You should use the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment the same way you'd use as 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 list: when you need one word to stand out from the text that describes
 it.
 The 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment gives you another way to do this, using a different overall
 layout.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMM
nesting You can nest 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environments inside one another, nest them in other types of lists, and
 so on.
 They work just like the other list paragraph environments.
 Read section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

 to learn about nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, this is a feature-packed paragraph environment!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To change the default width of the label, select the items in the list to
 change.
 You can also simply move the cursor into a 
\family sans
List
\family default
 item if you want to change only its label width.
 Now open the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
aragraph\InsetSpace ~
Settings
\family default
 dialog and find the 
\family sans
Label\InsetSpace ~
width
\family default
 text box.
 The text in the 
\family sans
Label\InsetSpace ~
width
\family default
 box determines the default label width.
 If you really, really want to, you can use the text of your largest label
 here, but you don't need to.
 We recommend using the letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 multiple times.
 It's the widest character and is a standard unit of width in LaTeX.
 The default label width in the example 
\family sans
List
\family default
 is 6 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

s wide.
 Using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

M
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as your unit of width in the 
\family sans
Label\InsetSpace ~
Width
\family default
 box has one more advantage: you don't need to keep changing the contents
 of 
\family sans
Label\InsetSpace ~
Width
\family default
 every time you alter a label in a 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's yet another feature of the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment we need to tell you about.
 As you can see in the examples, LyX left-justifies the item labels by default.
 You can use additional 
\family sans
HFills
\family default
 to change how LyX justifies the item label.
 We'll document 
\family sans
HFills
\family default
 later in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:hspace}

\end_inset

.
 Here are some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMM
Left The default for 
\family sans
List
\family default
 item labels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMM

\hfill
Right One 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
 at the beginning of the label right justifies it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMM

\hfill
Center
\hfill
 One 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
 at the beginning of the label and one at the end centers it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Don't worry if you have no idea what 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
s are yet.
 Just remember that you can use them to customize the look of the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That does it for the four paragraph environments for making lists.
 Oh - did we mention that you should read about nesting environments in
 section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

 if you want to use any of these list environments?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Letters
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
: An Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although LyX has document classes for letters, we've also created two paragraph
 environments called 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
.
 To use the letter class, you need to use specific paragraph environments
 in a specific order, otherwise LaTeX gags on the document.
 In contrast, you can use the 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 paragraph environments anywhere with no problem.
 You can even nest them inside other environments, though you can't nest
 anything in them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, you're not limited to using 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 for letters only.
 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
, in particular, is useful for creating article titles like those used in
 some European academic papers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Usage
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:adress_usage}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 environment formats text in the style of an address, which is also used
 for the opening and signature in some countries.
 Similarly, the 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 environment formats text in the style of a right-justified address, which
 is used for the sender's address and today's date in some countries.
 Here's an example of each:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Right Address
Right Address
\newline
WhoAmI
\newline
WhereAmI
\newline
When is it? What is today?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
.
 Notice that the lines all have the same left margin, which LyX sets to
 fit the largest block of text on a single line.
 Here's an example of the 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Address
WhoAreYou
\newline
Where do I send this
\newline
Your post office and country
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you can see, both 
\family sans
Address
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 add extra space between themselves and the next paragraph.
 Speaking of which, if you hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 in either of these environments, LyX resets the nesting depth and sets
 the environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 This makes sense, however, since 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 is the 
\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 function, and the individual lines of an address are not paragraphs.
 Thus, you'd use 
\family typewriter
break-line
\family default
 [
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Special\InsetSpace ~
F
\bar under

\bar under
L
\bar default
inebreak
\family default
 from the 
\family sans

\family sans

\family default
 or
\family sans
 Right\InsetSpace ~
Address
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Academic Writing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most academic writing begins with an abstract and ends with a bibliography
 or list of references.
 LyX contains paragraph environments for both of these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment is used for the abstract of an article.
 Technically, you 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 use this environment anywhere, but you really 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 only use it at the beginning of the document, after the title.
 The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment is only useful in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

article
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

report
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document classes [as well as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

amsart,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is just a specialized version of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

article
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

].
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document class ignores the 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 completely, and it's utterly silly to use 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

letter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 document class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment does several things for you.
 First, it puts the centered label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 above the text.
 The label and the text of the abstract are separated by some extra vertical
 space.
 Second, it typesets everything in a smaller font, just as you'd expect.
 Lastly, it adds a bit of extra vertical space between the abstract and
 the subsequent text.
 Well, that's how it will appear on the LyX screen.
 If your document is in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

report
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class, the abstract actually appears on a separate page in the printed
 version of the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting a new paragraph by hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset the paragraph environment.
 The new paragraph will still be in the 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment.
 So, you will have to change the paragraph environment yourself when you
 finish entering the abstract of your document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'd love to give you an example of the 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
 environment, but we can't, since this document is in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

book
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class.
 If you've never heard of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before, you can safely ignore this environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Bibliography
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:bibliography}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment is used to list references.
 Technically, you 
\emph on
could
\emph default
 use this environment anywhere, but you really 
\emph on
should
\emph default
 only use it at the end of the document.
 Also, don't bother trying to nest 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 in anything else or vice versa.
 It won't work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you first open a 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment, LyX add a large vertical space, followed by the heading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Bibliography
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

References,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 depending on the document class.
 The heading is in a large boldface font.
 Each paragraph of the 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment is a bibliography entry.
 Thus, hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset the paragraph environment.
 Each new paragraph is still in the 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the 
\emph on
beginning
\emph default
 of the 
\emph on
first line
\emph default
 of each paragraph, you will see a gray button showing a number.
 If you click on it, you will get a dialog in which you can set a 
\family sans
key
\family default
 and a 
\family sans
label
\family default
.
 The key is the symbolic name by which you will refer to this bibliography
 entry.
 For example, suppose your first entry in the bibliography was a book about
 LaTeX.
 We could choose the key 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

latexguide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for that entry.
 You can also give a label, which will be displayed in the gray inset box.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
key
\family default
 field isn't useless.
 You can refer to your bibliography entries using the 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
C
\bar default
itation
\family default
 command.
 Just choose the key inside in the available keys list, then add a reference
 by clicking on the left arrow, which will add it to the selected keys list.
 Multiple references can be placed by selecting more than one key.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Special Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are three standard paragraph environments that simply don't fit any
 category, as they are very specialized for a particular purpose.
 We'll point out the highlights and uses of each.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\family sans
Caption
\family default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:captionlayout}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
Caption
\family default
 environment is the default paragraph environment for 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Table\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
.
 On the LyX screen, you'll see either the label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Figure #:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Table #:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, depending on which type of 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 it's in.
 The actual reference number is substituted in this label in the printed
 output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can't really nest things into a 
\family sans
Caption
\family default
 environment.
 Additionally, hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 resets the paragraph environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
, so a 
\family sans
Caption
\family default
 can only be a single paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You cannot use a 
\family sans
Caption
\family default
 environment outside of a 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Float
\family default
 or a 
\family sans
Table\InsetSpace ~
Float
\family default
.
 See sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figures}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:tables}

\end_inset

 for more information on 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Table\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
LyX
\family sans
-Code
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment is another LyX extension.
 It type-sets text in a typewriter-style font.
 It also treats the 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 key as a fixed whitespace;
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
In the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment, the 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 key is treated as a 
\family sans
Protected\InsetSpace ~
Blank
\family default
 instead of an end-of-word marker.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 this is the only case in which you can type multiple whitespaces in LyX.
 If you need to insert blank lines, you'll still need to use 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
 [the 
\family typewriter
break-line
\family default
 function].
 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 breaks paragraphs.
 Note, however, that 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 reset the paragraph environment.
 So, when you finish using the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment, you'll need to change the paragraph environment yourself.
 Also, you 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 nest the 
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 environment inside of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few quirks with this environment:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot use 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
 at the beginning of a new paragraph [i.e.
 you can't follow 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 with a 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can't follow a 
\family sans
C-Return
\family default
 with a 
\family sans
Space
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Use a 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 to begin a new paragraph, then you can use a 
\family sans
Space
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Or: use 
\family sans
C-Space
\family default
 instead.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
You can't have an empty paragraph or an empty line.
 You must put at least one 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 in any line you want blank.
 Otherwise, LaTeX generates errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You cannot get the typewriter double quotes by typing 
\family sans
"
\family default
 since that will insert 
\emph on
real
\emph default
 quotes.
 You get the typewriter double quotes with 
\family sans
C-"
\family default
 (or 
\family sans
C-q
\family default
 if you use Emacs-like key bindings).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's an example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#include <stdio.h>
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
int main(void)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
{
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    printf("Hello World

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    return 0;
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
This is just the standard

\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
 has one purpose: to typeset code, such as program source, shell scripts,
 rc-files, and so on.
 Use it only in those very, very special cases where you need to generate
 text as if you used a typewriter.

\begin_layout Subsection
The Big Deal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Throughout the previous sections, we've been nagging you to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

go read Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:nest}

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So, you're probably wondering what the big deal is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The big deal is that LyX differs rather strongly from the traditional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word\SpecialChar \-
processor-as-overglorified-typewriter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 concept.
 With a typewriter, text is merely ink on a page.
 Most word processors aren't much better, treating text as pixels on the
 screen and bytes in memory.
 In contrast, LyX treats text as a unified block with a particular context
 and specific properties.
 However, what if you wanted one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

block
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to inherit some of the properties of another 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

block
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 ? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a more specific example: outlines.
 You have three main points in your outline, but point #2 also has two subpoints.
 In other words, you have a list 
\emph on
inside
\emph default
 of another list, with the inner list 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

attached
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to item #2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
one
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
two
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
sublist - item #1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
sublist - item #2
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
three
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How do you put a list inside of a list? By now, the answer should be obvious:
 you nest one list inside the other.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How to nest an environment is quite simple.
 Select 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
ncrease\InsetSpace ~
Environment\InsetSpace ~
Depth
\family default
 or
\family sans
\bar under
 D
\bar default
ecrease\InsetSpace ~
Environment\InsetSpace ~
Depth
\family default
 from the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit
\family default
 menu to change the nesting depth of the current paragraph (the status bar
 will tell you how far you are nested).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use the convenient key bindings 
\family sans
S-M-Left
\family default
 and 
\family sans
S-M-Right
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Left
\family default
 and 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Right 
\family default
are alternatives, if you prefer those bindings
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\family default
to change the nesting level.
 The change will work on the current selection if you have made one (allowing
 you to change the nesting of several paragraphs at once), or the current
 paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that LyX only changes the nesting depth if it can.
 If it's invalid to do so, nothing happens if you try to change the depth.
 Additionally, if you change the depth of one paragraph, it affects the
 depth of every paragraph nested inside of it.
 It's hard to describe what exactly LyX does in this case.
 That depends specifically on what your text looks like.
 Your best bet is to simply play with changing the nesting depth and see
 what happens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nesting isn't just limited to lists.
 In LyX, you can nest just about anything inside anything else, as you're
 about to find out.
 This is the real power of nesting paragraph environments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
What You Can and Can't Nest
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we fire a list of paragraph environments at you, we need to tell
 you a little bit more about how nesting works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The question of nesting is a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no,
 can you or can't you.
 There's also the question of how.
 Can you nest this environment into anything else? Can you nest another
 environment into it? A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to one of these doesn't guarantee a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paragraph environments in LyX can do one of three things when it comes
 to nesting.
 First, an environment may be completely unnestable.
 Second, there are environments that are fully nestable.
 You can nest them inside of things and you can also nest other things inside
 of them.
 There is one last type of environment.
 You can nest them into other environments, but that's it.
 You can't nest anything into them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a list of the three types of nesting behavior, and which paragraph
 environments have them:
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
For some odd reason, LyX allows you to fully nest both 
\family sans
Bibliography
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Abstract
\family default
.
 Also, LyX allows you to nest 
\family sans
Title
\family default
, 
\family sans
Author
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Date
\family default
 into other environments.
 We urge you not to.
 LaTeX may barf if you try it.
 Then again, it may not.
 We don't know for certain.
 However, it makes no sense contextually to perform any nesting with these
 environments, so why would you ever want to?

\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:table-and-fig-nesting}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several things that aren't paragraph environments, but which are
 affected by nesting anyhow.
 They are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
figures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
[Note: if you put a figure or a table in a 
\family sans

\family default
, this is no longer true.
 See below or look in sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figures}

\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:tables}

\end_inset

 for more info.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can treat these three objects as either a word or as a paragraph.
 Well, you can't inline a table, but you can inline math and figures.
 If a figure or an equation is inlined, it goes wherever the paragraph it's
 in goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, if you have an equation, figure or table in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

paragraph
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of its own, it behaves just like a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nestable-inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 paragraph environment.
 You can nest it into any environment, but you [obviously] can't nest anything
 into it.

As you can see, item (b) turned into the first item of a new list, but a

 item 1.
 The same thing would have happened to a figure or an equation.
 So, if you nest tables, figures or equations, make sure you go to the right
 depth!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then there are the so-called 
\family sans
Floats
\family default
.
 A 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 is a block of text associated with some sort of label, but which doesn't
 have a fixed location.
 It can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

float
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 forward or backward a page or two, to wherever it fits best.
 
\family sans
Footnotes
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Margin\InsetSpace ~
Notes
\family default
 are floats, as are 
\family sans
Table\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
.
 When you're editing a document in LyX, a closed 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 looks like a gray button with a red label and goes wherever the paragraph
 it's in goes.
 However, because a 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 has no fixed location in the final text, nesting has no effect on its actual
 location after you feed your document to LaTeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Usage and General Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Speaking of levels, LyX can perform up to a six-fold nesting.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

level #6
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the innermost possible depth.
 Here's an example to display what we mean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
level #1 - outermost
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #2
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #3
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
level #4
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
level #5
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
level #6
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Once again, LyX has a maximum of 6 levels, regardless of which specific
 paragraph environments you're using at a given level.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, LyX doesn't enforce this limitation.
 If you try to exceed it, however, LaTeX will return errors when you go
 to produce output for your document.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 That means that you can perform a six-fold nesting of a 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 list, or a 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 environment, and so on.
 You can also mix environments, as we shall see later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two exceptions to the six-fold nesting limit, and you can see
 both of them in the example.
 Unlike the other fully-nestable environments, you can only perform a four-fold
 nesting with the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments.
 For example, if we tried to nest another 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 list inside of item 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, we'd get errors.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subsection
Some Examples
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best way to explain just what you can do with nesting is by illustration.
 We have several examples of nested environments.
 In them, we explain how we created the example, so that you can reproduce
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #1: The Six-fold Way and Mixed Nesting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#1-a This is the outermost level.
 It's a 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#2-a This is level #2.
 We created it by using 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Right
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#3-a This is level #3.
 This time, we just hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, then used 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Right
\family default
 twice in a row.
 We could have also created it the same way as we did the previous level,
 by hitting 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Right
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This is actually a 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment, nested inside of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#3-a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, it's at level #4.
 We did this by hitting 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
, then 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Right
\family default
, then changing the paragraph environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
.
 Do this to create list items with more than one paragraph - it also works
 for the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
, and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's another 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 paragraph, also at level #4, made with just a 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#4-a This is level #4.
 We hit 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 and changed the paragraph environment back to 
\family sans
List
\family default
.
 Remember - we can't nest anything inside of a 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 environment, which is why we're still at level #4.
 However, we 
\emph on
can
\emph default
 keep nesting things inside of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

#3-a
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#5-a This is level #5\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#6-a \SpecialChar \ldots{}
and this is level #6.
 By now, you should know how we made these two.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#5-b Back to level #5.
 Just hit 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by a 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Left
\family default
.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#4-b After another 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by a 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Left
\family default
, we're back at level #4.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#3-b Back to level #3.
 By now it should be obvious how we did this.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#2-b Back to level #2.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Labeling
\labelwidthstring MMM
#1-b And last, back to the outermost level, #1.
 After this sentence, we'll hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 and change the paragraph environment back to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 to end the list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There you have it! Oh --- we could have also used the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
, 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
, or even the 
\family sans
Verse
\family default
 environment in place of the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
 The example would have worked exactly the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Example #2: Inheritance
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
This is the LyX-Code environment, at level #1, the outermost
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
level.
  Now we'll hit 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, then 
\family sans
M-p Right
\family default
, after which, we'll change to the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is the 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 environment, at level #2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Notice how the nested 
\family sans
Enumerate
\family default
 not only inherits its margins from its parent environment [
\family sans
LyX-Code
\family default
], but also inherits its font and spacing!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We ended this example by hitting 
\family sans
Return
\family default
.
 After that, we needed to reset the paragraph environment to 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 and resetting the nesting depth by using 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Left
\family default
 once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 We're actually going to nest a bunch of these.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #2.
 We used 
\family sans
M-Return
\family default
 followed by 
\family sans
M-p\InsetSpace ~
Right
\family default
.
 Now, what happens if we nest an 
\family sans

\family default
 environment inside of this one? It will be at level #3, but what will its
 label be? An asterisk?
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
No! It's a bullet.
 This is the 
\emph on
first
\emph default
 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environment, even though it's at level #3.
 So, its label is a bullet.
 [Note: we got here by using

 This time, however, we also changed the paragraph environment back to

 Notice the type of numbering! It's

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
What happens if we

 type of numbering does LyX use?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Oh, as if you couldn't guess by now, we're just using 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Let's use

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #4.
 Look what type of label LyX is using!
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
This is level #3.
 Even though we've changed levels, LyX is still using a lowercase Roman
 numeral as the label.
 Why?!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Because, even though the nesting depth has changed, the paragraph is 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 a thirdfold 
\family sans

 Notice, however, that LyX 
\emph on

\emph default
 reset the counter for the label.

\begin_layout Enumerate

 into the twofold-nested

\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
The same thing happens if we do another

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we reset the environment to

 As you can see, the level number doesn't correspond to what type of labelling
 LyX uses for the

 and 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 environments.
 The number of 
\emph on
other 
\family sans

\emph default
 surrounding it determines what kind of label LyX uses for an

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fonts and Text Styles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many modern typesetting and markup languages have begun to move towards
 specifying character styles rather than specifying a particular font.
 For example, instead of changing to an italicized version of the current
 font to emphasize text, you use an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

emphasized style
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 instead.
 This concept fits in perfectly with LyX.
 In LyX, you do things based on contexts, rather than focusing on typesetting
 details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right now, LyX allows you to specify a global default font, and has two
 character styles, 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Noun
\family default
.
 The 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 style corresponds to an italics font.
 The 
\family sans
Noun
\family default
 style corresponds to a font in smallcaps, which some languages and writing
 styles use to typeset proper names.
 The LyX Team has at last (as of LyX version\InsetSpace ~
1.4) introduced true character
 styles, but currently these must be defined explicitly in the document
 layout file.
 There's currently no GUI support to define new, or tweak existing, character
 styles to allow you, the user, to customize which font changes correspond
 to what styles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Global Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can set the default font from the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
 There are two options of interest here, 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
onts
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Font\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
S
\bar default
ize
\family default
.
 The possible options under 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
onts
\family default
 include 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
default
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and a list of fonts available on your system.
 The option 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
default
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 uses the standard TeX fonts, known as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

computer modern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (cm) or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

European modern
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (ec).
 Most systems will typically have some version of a Times and Helvetica
 font, with other variants.
 You'll have to examine this for yourself.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As for the 
\family sans
Font\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
S
\bar default
ize
\family default
 option, there are three possible values: 
\family sans
10
\family default
, 
\family sans
11
\family default
, and 
\family sans
12
\family default
.
 Remember, this is the 
\emph on
base
\emph default
 font size.
 LyX actually scales all of the other possible font sizes (such as those
 used in footnotes, superscripts, and subscripts) by this value.
 You can always fine-tune the font size from within the document if you
 need to.
 It's also rather silly to use an 8pt or 24pt font as the default font size,
 as this typically renders your document unreadable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that once you choose a new value for 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
onts
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Font\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
S
\bar default
ize
\family default
, LyX does 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 change the screen.
 You'll only see a difference once you generate the final output.
 This is part of the WYSIWYM concept.
 Besides, you have certainly noticed that "Roman" text on the LyX screen
 corresponds to the default font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Using Different Character Styles
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we've already seen, LyX automatically changes the character style for
 certain paragraph environments.
 We also mentioned two other character styles, 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Noun
\family default
.
 You can activate both of these styles via keybindings, the menus, and the
 toolbar.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To activate the 
\family sans
Noun
\family default
 style, do one of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
click on the toolbar button with the person-shaped icon
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
use the keybinding 
\family sans
M-c\InsetSpace ~
c
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These commands are all toggles.
 That is, if 
\family sans
Noun
\family default
 style is already active, they deactivate it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One typically uses the 
\family sans
Noun
\family default
 style for proper names.
 For example: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\noun on
Matthias Ettrich
\noun default
 is the original author of LyX.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more widely used character style is the 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 style.
 You can activate [or deactivate - it's also a toggle] the 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 style by:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
clicking on the toolbar button with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 character on it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
using the keybindings 
\family sans
M-c\InsetSpace ~
e
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the moment, the 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 style is equivalent to an italicized font.
 We have plans to make that association more user-configurable in the future.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We've been using the 
\family sans
Emphasized
\family default
 style all over the place in this document.
 Here's one more example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\emph on
Don't overuse character styles!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's also a warning in addition to an example.
 One's writing should parallel ordinary conversation.
 Since we don't all constantly scream at each other, we should also avoid
 the common tendency to overuse character style.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oh --- one last note: You can always reset to the default font using the
 keybinding 
\family sans
M-c\InsetSpace ~
Space
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fine-Tuning with the 
\family sans
Character Layout
\family default
 dialog
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are always occasions when you'll need to do some fine-tuning, so LyX
 gives you a way to create custom character style.
 For example, an academic journal or a corporation may have a style sheet
 requiring a sans-serif font be used in certain situations.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Note from 
\noun on
John Weiss
\noun default
: There is, in fact, such a style sheet for the LyX Documentation, since
 manuals need a certain amount of consistency.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Also, writers sometimes use a different font to offset a character's thoughts
 from ordinary dialogue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before we document how to use custom character style, we want to issue a
 warning yet again: Don't overuse character styles.
 Many modern word processors have a vast array of fonts available to them,
 providing you with the power of a printing press.
 Unfortunately, there is a tendency to overuse that power.
 The phrase, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Using a sledgehammer to swat a fly,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes to mind.
 And, as the old saying implies, documents that overuse different fonts
 and sizes tend to look like someone's knocked huge holes in them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Enough complaining.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use custom fonts, open the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Text\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
S
\bar default
tyle
\family default
 dialog.
 There are seven buttons on this dialog, each corresponding to a different
 font property which you can choose.
 You can choose an option for one of these seven properties, or select 
\family sans
No\InsetSpace ~
change
\family default
, which keeps the current state of that property.
 The item 
\family sans
Reset
\family default
 will reset the property to whatever is the default for the hosting paragraph
 environment.
 You can use this to reset attributes across a bunch of different paragraph
 environments in a snap.

\begin_layout Subsection
Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we've covered some of the basic features of document preparation
 using LyX, you probably want to know how to print out your masterpiece.
 Before we tell you that, however, we want to give you a quickie explanation
 of what goes on behind-the-scenes.
 We cover this information in much greater detail in the 
\emph on
Extended Features
\emph default
 manual as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX uses a program called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LaTeX
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as its backend.
 (Actually, LaTeX is just a macro package for the TeX typesetting system,
 but to prevent confusion, we'll just refer to the whole magilla as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LaTeX.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) Think of it this way: LyX is what you use to do your actual writing.
 Then, LyX calls LaTeX to turn your writing into printable output.
 This happens in a couple of stages:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
First, LyX converts your document to a series of text commands for LaTeX,
 generating a file with the extension, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
.tex
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Next, LaTeX uses the commands in the 
\family typewriter
.tex
\family default
 file to produce printable output.
 It doesn't know anything about your printer, however.
 Instead, LaTeX produces what's known as a 
\emph on
device-independent
\emph default
 file, or DVI for short.
 The actual output is in a file with the extension, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 DVI files are completely portable; you can move them from one machine to
 another without needing to do any sort of conversion.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Description
NOTE: The DVI file only contains what was in the LaTeX file itself.
 If you have included PostScript pictures in your document, there will only
 be a link to these files.
 So don't forget these files if you move your 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 file to another computer.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider the 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 file to be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

final output.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Once you have it, you can view it, print it, or convert it to other formats.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
You can view 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 files using a program called 
\family typewriter
xdvi
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Some printers and Unix systems understand DVI, and can print your 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 file directly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Nowadays, most printers understand the PostScript format.
 LyX automatically converts the 
\family typewriter
.dvi
\family default
 file to a PostScript file for you when you go to print out your document.
 LyX will also let you preview a PostScript version of your document using
 the program 
\family typewriter
ghostview
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
One advantage of using PostScript® is that the converter program [called
 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
] takes any PostScript graphics you may have included in your document and
 puts it into the resulting PostScript version of your document.
 It also includes any special fonts you may have used.
 That makes the PostScript version much, much more portable than the DVI
 version.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
LyX does all of these steps automagically for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As you have seen, a lot of things happen before you get a hardcopy or a
 preview of your document.
 So, don't worry if printing requires a bit more time than with other word
 processors.
 The printed result is worth the wait.
 Quality always has its price.

\begin_layout Standard
In general, using

One more note about hyphenation --- LyX automatically breaks up words and

 The words won't be hyphenated until you generate the final output.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actually, it's LaTeX that does this, and it will also hyphenate words in
 
\emph on
some
\emph default

 To know whether (PDF)LaTeX hyphenates for

\begin_layout Standard
When LyX calls LaTeX to generate the final version of your document, LaTeX
 automatically distinguishes between words, sentences, and abbreviations.
 LaTeX then adds the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

appropriate amount of space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: sentences get a little bit more space between the period and the next
 word.
 Abbreviations get the same amount of space after the period as a word uses.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, the algorithm for figuring out what's an abbreviation and
 what's the end of a sentence is really quite brain-dead.
 If a

Ligatures
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:ligatures}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is standard typesetting practice to group certain letters together and
 print them as single characters.
 These groups are known as 
\emph on
ligatures
\emph default
.
 Since LaTeX knows about ligatures, your LyX documents will contain them,
 too.
 Here are the possible ligatures:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
fl
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffi
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
ffl
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once in a while, though, you don't want a ligature in a word.
 While a ligature may be okay in the word, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

graffiti,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it looks really weird in compound words, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cufflink
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or the German 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dorffest.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 To break a ligature, use

\begin_layout Subsection
Widows and Orphans
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:widows}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the early days of word processors, page breaks went wherever the page
 happened to end.
 There was no regard for what was actually going on in the text.
 You may remember once printing out a document, only to find the heading
 for a new section printed at the very bottom of the page, the first line
 of a new paragraph all alone at the bottom of a page, or the last line
 of a paragraph at the top of a new page.
 These dangly-bits of text became known as 
\emph on
widows
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
orphans
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, LyX can avoid breaking pages after a section heading.
 That's part of the advantage of paragraph environments.
 But what about widows and orphans, where the page breaks leave one line
 of a paragraph all alone at the top or bottom of a page? There are rules
 built into LaTeX governing page breaks, and some of those rules are there
 to specifically prevent widows and orphans.
 This is the advantage LyX has in using LaTeX as its backend.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's no way we can go into how TeX and LaTeX decide to break a page,
 or how you can tweak that behavior.
 Some LaTeX books listed in the bibliography [such as\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{latexcompanion}

\end_inset

 or\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \cite{latexguide}

\end_inset

] may have more information.
 You will almost never need to worry about this, however.

 You will not see any numbers within LyX.
 You don't need to worry about those, anyhow, because LyX does the numbering
 for you, as well as putting the footnote at the bottom of the correct page,
 when it processes your file.
 If you want to turn already existing text into a footnote, simply mark
 it and click on the footnote button (a picture of text with an arrow pointing
 to stuff in the bottom margin).

Vice versa, you can change a footnote to regular text by hitting the

 key when the cursor is in the first position of a footnote, or by hitting
 the

NOTE: A float in LaTeX and LyX isn't a simple paragraph as with usual word
 processors.
 It is a complex text structure that may contain everything except floats.
 That means you can use all the layouts inside a float, even figures and

 You may not need this too often, but if you do occasionally need it, it's
 a neat feature.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a default, LyX uses 1.9 cm (0.75 inches) as the margin width to allow room
 for margin notes.
 This might not be what you're looking for, but as with footnotes, LyX cannot
 yet do everything LaTeX has to offer.
 You might want to consult your LaTeX handbook for additional commands.

Figures and Imported Graphics
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:figures}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No document preparation system is complete without the ability to import
 graphics from other utilities into the document.
 In LyX, these are referred to as ``figures'' whether they are actually
 figures in the traditional sense or simply some kind of imported image.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that figures referred to here are do not have captions and sit wherever
 in the document you place them.
 If you need one of these features, see sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figurefloats}

\end_inset

 below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To place a figure in your document, click on the second right-most icon

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This dialog has numerous parameters, though most should be self-explanatory.
 The 
\family sans
File
\family default
 tab allows you to choose your image file (note that a wide variety of image
 formats are supported automatically).
 The figure can be transformed by setting a rotation angle, using a bounding
 box, and scaling.
 Table\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{cap:Units-for-image}

\end_inset

 describes all available units.
 It is possible to set a bounding box automatically for some image formats
 (see the 
\family sans
Bounding\InsetSpace ~
Box
\family default
 tab).
 Note that it is possible to control the display of the figure in LyX and
 the display in the final document separately, which can be very useful
 for large figures.
 LaTeX wizards can specify additional LaTeX options in the 
\family sans
Extras
\family default
 tab.
 You can also set the 
\family sans
Subfigure
\family default
 option here, for use in figure floats (see Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figurefloats}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How it works
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has the ability to handle literally any graphics format in the known
 universe so long as a conversion path from this graphics format to the
 target output format can be created.
 If that sounds a little obtuse, consider how LyX handles Encapsulated PostScrip
t® figures.
 LaTeX provides native support for this format, so LyX needs do nothing
 other than use the 
\family typewriter

\backslash
includegraphics
\family default
 LaTeX command to insert the figure in the final document.

\begin_layout Standard
To view the figure on the LyX screen, however, some additional work is required
 because neither the XForms nor the Qt GUI libraries can load PostScript®
 figures themselves.
 The XForms library can load figures in the following, widely used graphics
 formats: 
\family typewriter
bmp
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
gif
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
jpeg
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
pbm
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
pgm
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
ppm
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
tif
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
xbm
\family default
 whilst the Qt library can also handle 
\family typewriter
mng
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
png
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
xpm
\family default
 format figures.
 Thus, LyX must initiate a conversion from Encapsulated PostScript® to a
 loadable graphics format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It does this using the powerful, configurable converters mechanism exposed
 in the 
\family sans
Converters
\family default
 section of the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit
\family default
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\family sans
\bar under
P
\bar default
references
\family default
 dialog.
 If LyX cannot create a conversion path (which might have many steps) from
 Encapsulated PostScript® to one of the loadable formats listed above, then
 it defaults to the use of ImageMagick's 
\family typewriter
convert
\family default
 utility.
 If, after all that, LyX 
\emph on
still
\emph default
 cannot load the figure, then it'll tell you so with a message 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Error converting to loadable format
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in place of an on-screen view of your figure.
 If you're presented with such a message, then you'll need to augment the
 list of known converters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This strategy is used both to generate on-screen views of your image and
 when generating the final document.
 In the latter case, the LaTeX compiler must be supplied with graphics files
 in PostScript® format.
 Similarly the PDFLaTeX compiler requires files in
\family typewriter
 pdf
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
png
\family default
 or 
\family typewriter
jpeg
\family default
 format.
 LyX will handle the necessary conversions behind the scenes.

Using Figure Floats
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:figurefloats}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The problem with inserting figures straight into your text is that they
 might make the pagination of your document extremely awkward.
 To suit the LyX mentality of automating such processes, you might find
 it preferable to use 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
, which LyX (actually, LaTeX) is free to move about your document as it
 deems necessary for a good fit.
 In return, LyX automates the listing of these figures and allows you to
 place a caption on them, using the 
\family sans
Caption
\family default
 environment explained in Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:captionlayout}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To place a 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Float
\family default
 simply select 
\family sans

\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Flo
\bar under
a
\bar default
t\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Figure

 You will get a float without a figure in it; use the toolbar icon described

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems simple, but there is subtlety involved in the placement of the
 caption.
 If you prefer your caption to appear below the figure, then you must press
 return when the cursor is at the very start of the caption, and insert
 the figure in the new paragraph created above the caption; or you can delete
 the caption and recreate it by selecting the 
\family sans
Caption 
\family default
environment after the figure has been inserted.
 This is what we did for figure 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:kill-plat}

\end_inset

.
 If the cursor is in a paragraph after the caption when you insert the 
\family sans
Figure
\family default
 then it will be inserted after the caption, as was the case for 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:escher}

\end_inset

.
 It is preferred to use one 
\family sans
Figure
\family default
 per 
\family sans
Float
\family default
.
 This allows LyX [actually LaTeX] to best position each figure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Right-clicking on a float opens a dialog where you can alter the placement
 options that LaTeX uses for positioning the float (see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:float-locn}

\end_inset

).
 
\family sans
Span\InsetSpace ~
columns
\family default
 is only useful for two-column documents: if you select it, the float will
 span across both columns on the page instead of being confined to just
 one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This figure also shows how we place a label and create a cross-reference
 to it; as you would expect from reading section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:crossref}

\end_inset

 you can simply insert a 
\family sans
\bar under
L
\bar default
abel
\family default
 in the caption and refer to it using a 
\family sans
\bar under
C
\bar default
ross\InsetSpace ~
Reference
\family default
 as normal.
 It is especially important to use these with figure floats, rather than
 using vague references to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the above figure,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as LaTeX will reposition your floats for you in the final document; it
 might not be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

above
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at all.
 If it is not possible to fit the floats neatly on the same page as the
 text which refers to it, the figures will be placed on a separate page
 by themselves.
 Rest assured that the overall effect is usually quite nice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the caption is used in a 
\family sans
List\InsetSpace ~

\bar under
F
\bar default
igures
\family default
 (as described in Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:ListsOf}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Float Placement
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:float-locn}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, the whole idea behind 
\family sans
Figure\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
 [as well as 
\family sans
Table\InsetSpace ~
Floats
\family default
, which we introduce later] is to allow LyX to place a figure [or table]
 on a page in a consistent, sensible fashion.
 The rules LaTeX uses are rather arcane; refer to the LaTeX documentation
 for the exact details.
 You can use check boxes in the float dialog to set placement for a particular
 float.
 By default, each float uses the document's default placement rules.
 You can change these, if you wish, in the 
\family sans
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog.
 The 
\family sans
Float\InsetSpace ~
placement
\family default
 box takes a LaTeX-style placement specification.
 You can place any combination of four letters in the 
\family sans
Float\InsetSpace ~
placement
\family default
 box, in any order:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
h
\family default

\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
t
\family default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

b
\family default
 for 
\emph on
bottom
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
p
\family default
 for 
\emph on
page
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The letters correspond to the following behaviour:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Here: LyX tries to put the 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 at the same point in the text where you put it.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If there isn't enough room, LyX tries one of the other three location types.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Description
Top: LyX tries to put the 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 at the top of the current page.
 If the figure won't fit on the current page, it goes to the next page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Bottom: LyX tries to put the 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 at the bottom of the current page.
 If there isn't room, it goes to the next page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Page: LyX tries to put the 
\family sans
Float
\family default
 (or a number of 
\family sans
Float
\family default
s) on a page of its own.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is some subtlety to how this all works.
 The order specifies what location LyX should try first.
 If that one fails, it tries the next one, and so on, though 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
h
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will always take precedence if it appears in the list.
 The default placement list is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
tbp
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: try the top of a text page first, then the bottom of a text page, then
 on a page by itself.
 If you want LyX to try 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

really hard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to place the figure where you command it, precede the list with an exclamation
 point; for example 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
!htbp
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Here are some example entries and what they do:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Try putting the figure/table at its actual position in the text.
 If that doesn't work, put it on the bottom of the page.

\begin_layout Subsection
XFig and LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One obvious question is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how would I create the figures?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Fortunately, the answer is included in most Linux and/or LaTeX distributions.
 
\family typewriter
XFig
\family default
 is a powerful though slightly awkward drawing tool.
 If you want to include figures that you have created with 
\family typewriter
XFig
\family default
 there are several ways.
 We recommend the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Export the figure as Encapsulated PostScript.
 This could be very easy included into LyX as described in the previous
 sections.
 The great advantage of this way is, that you have the full power of PostScript®
 available.
 That means Bezier curves, colors, all line thicknesses and many more.
 If you have inserted text into your fig-document this will be printed with
 PostScript fonts, which is OK\SpecialChar \@.
 The figure can be manipulated like any other
 EPS figure, as described above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The only disadvantage is that you cannot create formulas as PostScript text
 except by hand.
 If you also need formulas or simple exponents or indices in your figure,
 the next way is recommended.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Export the figure as LaTeX.
 This is just as easy to include into LyX, with the advantage that you may
 use all LaTeX commands within the text inside XFig.
 Therefore you have to set the 
\emph on
special flag 
\emph default
for text in XFig.
 This is automatic if you invoke XFig with 
\family typewriter
xfig\InsetSpace ~
-specialtext
\family default
.
 If this is done and you have also chosen a LaTeX font you may simply write
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

$H_2$
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in 
\family typewriter
XFig\SpecialChar \@.

\family default
 If you export this figure as LaTeX and include it in LyX with
\family sans
\bar under
 I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Chil
\bar under
d
\bar default
\InsetSpace ~
Document
\family default
 (see description in 
\emph on
Extended Features
\emph default
) this text will appear as 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
The disadvantage of this way is that the graphical power of LaTeX isn't
 as strong as PostScript®\SpecialChar \@.
 You cannot use all thicknesses of lines and, more
 annoyingly, not all slopes.
 This is why we recommend the third way for more complex figures.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Export the figure as LaTeX/PostScript combined.
 Then 
\family typewriter
XFig
\family default
 [
\family typewriter
transfig
\family default
, really] will generate two files: 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
the PostScript part 
\family typewriter
foo.pstex
\family default
, that contains all painting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
the LaTeX part 
\family typewriter
foo.pstex_t
\family default
, that contains all text and a link to the PostScript part.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Then you just have to include the LaTeX part as described above.
 This will automatically include the PostScript part, too.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
If you get an error like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unknown graphics extension pstex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you have to declare these graphic extensions.
 I think this is a 
\family typewriter
transfig
\family default
 bug that occurs with LaTeX2e.
 Simply add a line like
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter

\backslash
@namedef{Gin@rule@ps_tex}#1{{eps}{ps_tex}{#1}}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
in the file 
\family typewriter
/usr/lib/texmf/tex/latex/graphics/dvips.def
\family default
.
 Then add 
\family typewriter
pstex
\family default
 to the extension:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\backslash
def
\backslash
Gin@extensions{eps, ps, pstex, eps.gz, ps.gz, eps=2EZ}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This should fix the whole thing.
 Alternatively you may export the postscript part as 
\family typewriter
foo.eps
\family default
 and change the LaTeX part 
\family typewriter
foo.pstex_t
\family default
 manually.
 But this is annoying.
 
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This way you have the full PostScript® and LaTeX power combined except
 for the possibility to scale the figure after creating.
 So if you want scalable pictures, the PostScript format is your only choice.
 Another little advantage of letting LaTeX typeset the font is that the
 same font will appear in your figures as in your text, which looks a little
 nicer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Tables
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:tables}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has powerful table support, but LaTeX can do many more things with tables
 than LyX is currently capable of, so you might want to look at a good LaTeX
 book if the features described here should turn out to be inadequate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can insert a table using either the table toolbar button or 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
T
\bar default
able
\family default
.
 A dialog will appear, asking you for the number of rows and columns.
 The default table has lines at the top and to the left of every cell, a
 line to the right of the rightmost column and a line at the bottom of the
 lowest row, forming a box around the table.
 Additionally, the topmost row also has a line at the bottom, which causes
 this row to appear separated from the rest of the table.
 Here's an example:
\end_layout

The Table dialog
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can alter a table by clicking on it with the right mouse button, which
 brings up a settings dialog.
 Among these options are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Adding/removing border lines from a row or column.
 If you remove the top line from one of the rows, you'll get a dotted line
 in LyX, but no line will appear in the printout.
 If you set the bottom line of one row and the top line of the row below,
 then the rows are separated by a small space, as you can see with the top
 row in the example above.
 You can do the same vertically if you set the right line of a column and
 the left line of the column to the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Text alignment in a column
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Appending rows and columns
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Deleting rows, columns, or the entire table
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multicolumn
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Setting a fixed width for a column
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Longtable options - this is useful if your table is higher than the paper.
 Then the table is split on the bottom of the page and continued on the
 next one, instead of running of the end of the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rotate the whole table or a single cell sideways, by 90 degrees
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use the menu to perform these operations.
 Try 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\family default
\bar under
T
\family sans
\bar default
able
\family default
 or 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Rows&
\bar under
C
\bar default
ols
\family default
 when the cursor is inside a table.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of these options also work on selections.
 This means that if you select more cells, columns or rows the action is
 done on all of your selection.
 Note that there is a difference between selecting the 
\emph on
contents
\emph default
 of the cell, and the cell itself.
 If you can see a red border inside a cell, then a selection will select
 the contents.
 If you press 
\family sans
Escape
\family default
 or click outside of the box, then the selection will select cells (whether
 you use the mouse or the normal cursor-movement keys).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you append a row, it is added 
\emph on
below
\emph default
 the row containing the cursor.
 Similarly, columns are appended to the 
\emph on
right
\emph default
 of the cursor.
 This makes it difficult to add columns on the left edge of a table without
 a lot of cutting and pasting.
 Deletion is always performed on the row or column containing the cursor.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multicolumn option merges two or more adjacent cells on a given row.
 For example, in the above table, row 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 To use it, you must first select the cells, then choose 
\family sans
Multicolumn
\family default
 from the menu.
 This will not work vertically - see the Table Examples document for how
 to do this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also use 
\family sans
Multicolumn
\family default
 if you need to have a special handling for a single table cell's top and
 bottom border lines and text alignment.
 Here an example of this special handling of a cell:

You see here that the header line cells are aligned to the center, whereas
 the left column is aligned to the left, and the other columns are aligned
 to the right.
 Also the bottom and top line of two cells have been removed.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want your column to have a fixed width, then you can insert a width
 in the 
\family sans
Width
\family default
\emph on
 
\emph default
input-field of the 
\family sans
Table
\family default
 dialog.
 This will then allow the cell to have multiple paragraphs of text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If your table becomes too large to fit on a portrait document layout, you
 can select the 
\family sans
Rotate\InsetSpace ~
90°
\family default
 button, and the table will appear sideways (this means landscape in a portrait
 document style).
 You might also like to rotate single table cells to give them more horizontal
 space.
 The example below demonstrates why it is useful to rotate single cells.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Note:
\emph default
 This 
\family sans
Rotate\InsetSpace ~
90°
\family default
 option will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 display on screen, and works 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 for PostScript output.
 So, if you want to preview them, use 
\family sans
\bar under
V
\bar default
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Pos
\bar under
t
\bar default
script
\family default
, as 
\family sans
\bar under

\bar default
iew
\bar under
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

 will not show the table properly.

What can be placed inside a table cell?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many objects can be placed inside a table cell.
 Any single line of text, an equation (not a displayed or multilined equation,
 though), or a figure can be in a cell; in fact, all three kinds of objects
 can be placed in the same cell.
 Font sizes and shapes can be altered, and the table will adjust to display
 them properly.
 However, you can't put a special environment in a cell (like 
\family sans
Section*
\family default
, etc.), nor set spacing options etc.
 for the cell's paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cut & Paste in Tables
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cutting and pasting between tables works reasonably well.
 You can cut and paste even more than one row.
 Selection with the mouse or with 
\family sans
Shift
\family default
 plus the arrow keys works as usual.
 The values in the second table below were cut and pasted from the first,
 using the mouse to select and paste.

Multiple lines in cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to have multi-line entries in tables, but not in a completely
 WYSIWYM manner.
 Define a fixed length for the column in the 
\family sans
Table
\family default
 dialog.
 After this, your text is automatically split into more lines and the cell
 enlarged vertically when the length of the text exceeds the given fixed
 length.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Text within a cell will not normally wrap to fit the page, so if a line
 of text in a table is too long, the table will extend beyond the right
 margin of the page.
 Similarly, tables will not split themselves at the bottom of a page, and
 so might extend below the bottom margin.
 You have these options to resolve this problem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Split it into two tables.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Select the 
\family sans
Longtable 
\family default
button in the 
\family sans
Table
\family default
 dialog.
 This automatically splits the table over more pages, if it is too tall.
 After doing this, the list of 
\family sans
Longtable
\family default
 buttons activate themselves and you may now define:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
First\InsetSpace ~
header
\family default
: The current row and all rows above that don't have any special options
 defined are defined to be the header rows of the first page of the longtable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
Header
\family default
: The current row and all rows above that don't have any special options
 defined are defined to be the header rows of all pages of the longtable;
 except for the first page, if 
\family sans
First\InsetSpace ~
header
\family default
 is defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
Footer
\family default
: The current row and all rows below that don't have any special options
 defined are defined to be the footer rows of all pages of the longtable;
 except for the last page, if 
\family sans
Last\InsetSpace ~
footer
\family default
 is defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\family sans
Last\InsetSpace ~
footer
\family default
: The current row and all rows below that don't have any special options
 defined are defined to be the footer rows of the last page of the longtable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you set more than one option in the same table row, you should be aware
 of the fact that only the first flag is used in the given table rows.
 The others will then be defined as 
\emph on
empty
\emph default
.
 In this context, first means first in this order: 
\family sans
Footer, Last\InsetSpace ~
footer,
\family default
 
\family sans
Header,
\family default
 
\family sans
First\InsetSpace ~
header.

\family default
\emph on
 
\emph default
See the 
\family typewriter
TableExamples.lyx
\family default
 example file to see how this works.

\emph on
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The check box in the long table options can be used to specify specific
 rows to break the page on as well.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
A table can also be placed in a float, as described below, which will allow
 TeX to place it as well as it can within the page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Table Floats
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:table float}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Outside of a float, the table will be positioned exactly where it is placed
 in the document.
 Using a 
\family sans
\shape up
Tabl
\bar under
e
\bar default
\InsetSpace ~
Float
\family default
\shape default
 from the 
\family sans
\shape up

I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Flo
\shape default
\bar under
a
\shape up
\bar default
t
\family default
\shape default
 menu will enable LaTeX to place the table where it fits best, rather than
 exactly where you insert it.
 Float placement for table floats is similar to that for figure floats 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figurefloats}

\end_inset

, and is described in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:float-locn}

\end_inset

.
 Captions also work the same way as with figure floats, as described in
 section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figurefloats}

\end_inset

.
 Table 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{table:a table float}

\end_inset

 is an example of a table float.
\begin_inset Float table

\begin_layout Standard
One of the really nice features of LaTeX is the ease with which it lets
 you create various 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lists,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 such as a Table of Contents.
 All you need to do is to use certain environments and insert a reference
 at the place where you want the list to appear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
The Table of Contents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to get a Table of Contents, you need to do four things:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use a document class that includes support (all but 
\family typewriter
letter
\family default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Set paragraph environments appropriately: 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
, 
\family sans
(Sub...) Section
\family default
, 
\family sans
(Sub...), Paragraph
\family default
.
 Note that styles with a 
\family sans
*
\family default
, like 
\family sans
Section*
\family default
, will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 appear in the Table of Contents.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Make sure you set the

\begin_layout Subsection
List of Figures, Tables and Algorithms
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:ListsOf}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table, figure, and algorithm lists are very much like the table of contents.
 You can insert them from the

 If you want figures, tables, or algorithms to appear in the list, you must
 place them inside a float of the relevant type and add a caption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Chapter
Mathematical Formulae
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic Math Editing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To create a math formula, you can just click on the toolbar icon with 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{a+b}{c}$
\end_inset

 on it.
 That will open a little blue square, with purple markers around it, on
 the corners.
 That blue square is the formula itself; the purple markers indicate what
 level of nesting within the formula you are at.
 You can also choose a particular formula type to insert via the 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert
\bar under
\SpecialChar \menuseparator
M
\bar default
ath
\family default
 menu; or you can use a keyboard macro, 
\family sans
M-c\InsetSpace ~

\family default
, 
\family sans
M-m\InsetSpace ~
m
\family default
, or 
\family sans
C-m
\family default
 (CUA binding only).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you simply need to type a single Greek letter, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, there is a special shortcut.
 Just type 
\family sans
M-m\InsetSpace ~
g\InsetSpace ~
a
\family default
 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

,
\family sans
 M-m\InsetSpace ~
g\InsetSpace ~
b
\family default
 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editing the parameters of a formula may be done from the 
\family sans

, or by clicking the right mouse button on the formula.
 The math panel is very useful, so you may want to open it and leave it
 somewhere on the screen.
 If you're not already in a formula, selecting anything from the math panel
 will insert a formula for you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Navigating a Formula
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The best control over cursor position within an existing formula is achieved
 with the arrow keys.
 Mathed uses small squares to indicate places where something can be inserted.
 The arrow keys can be used to navigate between parts of a formula.
 Pressing 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 will leave a fraction or other formula construct (a square root 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

, or parentheses 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(f\right)$
\end_inset

, or a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
3 & 4\end{array}\right]$
\end_inset

).
 Pressing 
\family sans
Escape
\family default
 will leave the formula, placing the cursor after the formula.

\family sans
 Tab
\family default
 can be used to move horizontally in a formula; for example, through the
 cells of a matrix or the positions in a multi-line equation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans
Space
\family default
 seems to do nothing in Mathed, since it does not in fact add a space between
 characters, but it does exit a nested structure.
 For this reason, you have to be careful about using 
\family sans
Space
\family default
.
 For example, if you want 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2x+1}$
\end_inset

, type 
\family typewriter

\backslash
sqrt
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~

\family default
then 
\family sans
Space
\family default
, then
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
2x+1
\family default
, not 
\family typewriter

\backslash
sqrt
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~
Space\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
2x
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~
Space\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
+
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~
Space\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
1
\family default
, since in the latter case only the 
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $2x$
\end_inset


\family default
 will be under the square root sign, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2x}+1$
\end_inset

.
 For those who learned to space out expressions in this way, it takes a
 little unlearning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can leave many parts of a formula, like this matrix, partially filled
 in, such as:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\lambda_{1}\\
 & \ddots\\
 &  & \lambda_{n}\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

If you leave a fraction only partially filled in, or a subscript with nothing
 in it, the results will be unpredictable, but most constructs don't mind.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selecting Text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can select text within a formula in two different ways.
 Place the cursor at one end of the string of text you want, and press 
\family sans
Shift 
\family default
and a cursor movement key to select text.
 It will be highlighted as with regular text selection.
 Alternatively, you can select text with the mouse in the usual way.
 That text can then be cut or copied, and then pasted within any formula
 (not in a plain text region in LyX, though).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Exponents and Subscripts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can use the math panel to add superscripts or subscripts, but the much
 easier way is to use the standard TeX method.
 To get 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

, type (in Mathed) 
\family typewriter
x^2
\family default
 then 
\family sans
Space
\family default
.
 The final 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 puts the cursor back down on the base line of the expression, instead of
 in the superscript.
 If you type 
\family typewriter
x^2y
\family default
, you will get 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2y}$
\end_inset

, to get 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}y$
\end_inset

, type 
\family typewriter
x^2
\family sans
 
\family default
then 
\family sans
Space 
\family default
then
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~

\family typewriter
y
\family default
.
 Subscripts are similar, to get 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

, type (in Mathed) 
\family typewriter
a_1
\family sans
\InsetSpace ~

\family default
then
\family sans
 Space
\family default
.
 Note that by default, the superscript or subscript is only for the single
 symbol to the left, which changes the spacing and alignment; you should
 read section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Grouping}

\end_inset

 if you need to alter this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fractions 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Create a fraction with either 
\family typewriter

\backslash
frac
\family sans
 
\family default
(in Mathed) or using the fraction icon in the 
\family sans
Math\InsetSpace ~
Panel
\family default
 dialog or the 
\family sans
\bar under
M
\bar default
ath
\family default
 menu item 
\family sans
\bar under
F
\bar default
raction
\family default
.
 You will be presented with an empty fraction, with two Mathed insertion
 squares top and bottom.
 The cursor moves immediately to the top of the fraction.
 To move to the bottom, simply press 
\family sans
Down
\family default
.
 To move back up, press 
\family sans
Up
\family default
.
 Any math structure can be placed in a fraction, as this example shows:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\frac{1}{\left(\begin{array}{cc}
2 & 3\\
4 & 5\end{array}\right)}\right]\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Sums and Integrals 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sum (
\begin_inset Formula $\sum$
\end_inset

) and integral (
\begin_inset Formula $\int$
\end_inset

) signs are very often decorated with one or more sets of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

limits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These limits can be entered in LyX by entering them as you would enter
 a superscript or subscript, directly after the symbol.
 Sum will automatically place its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

limits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 over and under the symbol in display style, but will move them to the side
 when inlined, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}=e$
\end_inset

, versus 
\begin_inset Note Note
status open

\begin_layout Standard
We haven't yet explained what display vs.
 inline means...
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n}=\ln\left(\frac{1}{1-x}\right).\]

\end_inset

Integral signs, however, will not by default move the limits to directly
 over and under the integral sign in display style, as in 
\begin_inset Formula $\int_{a}^{x}f(t)dt:=F(x)$
\end_inset

, versus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{dx}{1+x^{2}}=\pi.\]

\end_inset

Both symbols will be automatically re-sized when placed in display mode.
 In display mode, the placement of the limits (directly above and below,
 or offset to the right from the sign) can be changed by placing the cursor
 in front of the sign and hitting 
\family sans
M-m l
\family default
.
 Exactly what change occurs depends on the sign.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Certain other mathematical expressions have this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

moving limits
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 feature as addition, such as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x),\]

\end_inset

which will place the 
\begin_inset Formula $x\rightarrow\infty$
\end_inset

 underneath the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lim
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in display mode, but not in inlined mode, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty}f(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim$
\end_inset

 was entered as a function - you get it in LyX by typing 
\family typewriter

\backslash
lim 
\family default
in math-mode, or choosing from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 menu in the math panel; see 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:math-functions}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

) has a more extensive list of symbols and structures.
 As stated earlier, you can keep the math panel open when writing mathematics.
 The use of the panel should be fairly obvious; we'll describe some of the
 details in later sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that right-clicking on a formula opens the panel as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Other Math Symbols 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most math symbols can be found in the math panel under one of several categories
; including 
\family sans
Greek
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma\rho\epsilon\epsilon\kappa$
\end_inset

, 
\family sans
operators
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm\times$
\end_inset

\family sans

\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq\cong$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\uparrow\Leftrightarrow$

\family sans
large\InsetSpace ~
operators
\family default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum\int$
\end_inset

, and the dreaded 
\family sans
miscellaneous
\family default
.
 There are also the additional symbols provided by the American Mathematical
 Society (AMS).
 If you know the standard LaTeX macro for a particular symbol you which
 to use, you do not have to use these dialogs, but they will help for those
 symbols whose LaTeX name you do not know.
 Note that the AMS symbols will not be displayed as symbols in LyX unless
 you install the right fonts as described in the relevant manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible to get an nth root symbol.
 In the minibuffer, type 
\family typewriter
math-insert root
\family default
.
 This generates a root symbol with an extra box above the root sign.
 Use 
\family sans
Up
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Down
\family default
 to move between the two boxes.
 You can also use the key binding 
\family sans
M-m-r
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Altering spacing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may want to create blank spaces that differs from the standard spacing
 that LaTeX provides.
 We don't recommend this as a matter of course, since the whole idea of
 WYSIWYM is that you don't think about the typesetting, but the content.
 However, there are situations where you will want to add spaces.
 The first thing to do is to type 
\family sans
C-Space
\family default
.
 This generates a small space, and shows a small marker on the screen within
 LyX: 
\begin_inset Formula $a\, b$
\end_inset

.
 The next trick is to change that space to different sizes.
 
\emph on
Before
\emph default
 you move the cursor, after typing 
\family sans
C-Space
\family default
, if you hit 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 again, you will change the size of the space, through a number of variable
 sizes.
 The last ones in the list are red, and are a negative space.
 For example: 
\begin_inset Formula $a\quad b$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $a\! b$
\end_inset

.
 You can also insert these spaces via the math panel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Math functions
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:math-functions}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The math panel contains a number of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

functions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 (you can type them in a formula by typing 
\family typewriter

\backslash
sin
\family default
 etc).
 Standard mathematical practice is that functions which are names, like
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin$
\end_inset

, should not be italicized.
 Entering just the letters 
\begin_inset Formula $sin$
\end_inset

 within Mathed will give italics, of course, so these special macros are
 available.
 They do more to the final output than just change the typeface, however.
 For example, the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\sin t$
\end_inset

 will typeset with a little extra space between the n and the t.
 For words which are more sophisticated mathematical objects, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim$
\end_inset

, the macro changes the way that subscripts are placed, depending on whether
 the math-inset is inlined or displayed: 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{x\rightarrow0}f(x)=L$
\end_inset

 versus
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lim_{x\rightarrow0}f(x)=L.\]

\end_inset

These two expressions were typed the same way, but using the macro 
\family typewriter

\backslash
lim
\family default
 alters the appearance (actually, it is the inlined version that is altered,
 to improve linespacing).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Accents
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a formula you can insert accented characters in the same way as in text
 mode.
 This may depend on your keyboard, or the bindings file you use.
 You can also use TeX macro equivalents, as macros.
 That is, you can enter 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{a}$
\end_inset

 to get the same effect if your keyboard does not have accents enabled.
 This is entered by typing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter

\backslash
hat a
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in Mathed.
 These are the equivalences between the text names and the macro names for
 the various accents:

\begin_layout Subsection
The math editor for LaTeX users
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Editing mathematical expressions in LyX can be done in one of two ways.
 You can use the native LyX support for rendering the formulae in a WYSIWYM
 fashion.
 LaTeX users might like to be able to use the keyboard to enter things like
 
\family typewriter
$
\backslash
alpha$
\family default
 (this gets, in ordinary TeX, an 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in the final document), believing that it is faster than chasing around
 menus for a symbol.
 Here's a testimonial of one of those old LaTeX users, 
\noun on
David Johnson:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
I was finally convinced that the math editor was the way to go when I found
 that, with a few modifications, I could use it the same way I was accustomed
 to writing TeX.
 As an example, I created this 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 by typing the following keys: First type
\family typewriter
 
\family sans
M-c\InsetSpace ~
m
\family typewriter
 
\family default
to enter
\family typewriter
 math-mode
\family default
, then type
\family typewriter
 
\backslash
alpha
\family sans
 
\family default
, then 
\family sans
Space 
\family default
and
\family sans
 Esc
\family default
.
 As soon as I typed that 
\family sans
Space
\family default
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 was right there on the screen.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family sans
M-c\InsetSpace ~
m
\family default
 sequence inserts a formula (you may also use 
\family sans
C-m
\family default
 or 
\family sans
M-m\InsetSpace ~
m
\family default
), the
\family typewriter
 
\backslash
alpha
\family default
 is of course the standard TeX command for a Greek alpha letter, and the
 
\family sans
Esc
\family default
 leaves the formula.
 Some of the advantages of this approach are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You have immediate visual feedback to be sure your TeX was correct
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You have the real mathematical expression on the screen, correctly displayed,
 to make sure your mathematics is correct (correctly written, at least)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
All the new LaTeX fuss with special environments and such are taken care
 of by LyX, not you
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You won't have to chase through the code trying to find that missing 
\family sans
$
\family default
 or extra 
\family sans
{
\family default
 any more
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If you don't remember the LaTeX name of a particular symbol, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\wp$
\end_inset

, you can find it in the dialogs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Brackets and decorations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several brackets available through LyX.
 For most purposes, using just the keys 
\family typewriter
[{]}()|
\backslash
<>
\family default
 should suffice, but the effect, especially if you want to surround a large
 structure, such as a matrix or a fraction, or if you have several layers
 of brackets, is better using the math panel's 
\family sans
Delimiter
\family default
 dialog [see sec.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:math-panel}

\end_inset

].
 For example, that's how you would construct the brackets around a standard
 matrix such as :
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
3 & 4\end{array}\right],\]

\end_inset

and to make it easier to see the layers of parentheses of an abomination
 such as: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{\left(1+\left(\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{1}{1+x}\right)}\right)\right)}\]

\end_inset

or:
\begin_inset Formula \[
f\left(g\left(h\left(k\left(l\left(x\right)\right)\right)\right)\right).\]

\end_inset

The parentheses, and other brackets, from that menu will automatically re-size
 to accommodate the size of what is inside (This is done in straight LaTeX
 by 
\family typewriter

\backslash
left( blah 
\backslash
right)
\family default
 ).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is very easy to construct the braces you want to use.
 Click on the brace you want on the left side with the left mouse button,
 the right side with the right button, and place them in the document by
 clicking on the button.
 If you want one side to not have a bracket, use the blank button.
 It will appear in LyX with a dotted line, but nothing will print.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you decide after the fact to place parentheses (or other math structure,
 like a square root, or other decoration) around some math structure, you
 can do that by highlighting (selecting) the structure that is to go inside
 the parentheses (that is done by holding the 
\family sans
Shift
\family default
 key down and moving the cursor with the arrow keys, or selecting with the
 mouse).
 Then, choose the appropriate brackets for left and right, and click on
 
\family sans
Apply
\family default
.
 The parentheses will be drawn around the selected structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're trying to enter a LaTeX 
\family typewriter
{
\family default
 for grouping, you should read 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Grouping}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Grouping
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Grouping}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may need to group a set of symbols.
 In LaTeX, for example, the typesetting of 
\family typewriter
{x^y}^z
\family default
 is different from 
\family typewriter
x^{y^z}
\family default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula \[
{x^{y}}^{z}\quad\mathrm{differs\; from}\quad x^{{y^{z}}}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, trying to type the 
\family typewriter
}
\family default
 in LyX gives an actual closing brace in the output.
 To create this grouping, you need to use the key sequence 
\family typewriter

\backslash
{
\family default
 then type space.
 Inside LyX, you will see red braces indicating the grouping.
 The example directly above shows how this works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Arrays and Multi-line Equations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Arrays, such as matrices, are easily entered in LyX.
 In the 
\family sans
Math\InsetSpace ~
Panel 
\family default
there is a matrix button, which will open a dialog for you to choose the
 number of rows/columns.
 Here is an example:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 2 & 3\\
4 & 5 & 6\\
7 & 8 & 9\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

The parentheses aren't automatic, but you can add them as usual.
 Remember that you can add this after the fact, by highlighting the matrix
 inside Mathed (Position the mouse on one side of the matrix, hold the 
\family sans
Shift
\family default
 key down, and hit the appropriate arrow key to move the cursor across the
 matrix).
 You can, when you construct the matrix, decide whether the columns (or
 some of them) will be left-, right-, or center-justified.
 The specification is 
\family typewriter
ccc 
\family default
by default.
 Each letter corresponds to the relevant column.
 For example, 
\family typewriter
lcr
\family default
 means that the first column will be left-justified, the second will be
 centered, and the third column will be right-justified..
 It will look like this:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\begin{array}{lcr}
this & this\, column & this\, column\\
column & has & has\, right\\
has\, left\, alignment & center\, alignment & alignment\end{array}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add more rows to an existing matrix by hitting 
\family sans

\begin_layout Standard
There are numerous other arrays used in LaTeX math-mode, particularly with
 the AMS-LaTeX packages included, such as 
\family typewriter

\backslash

\family default
 and commutative diagrams.
 Not all of these are supported in LyX but some are, see

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi-line equations are very easy to construct in LyX.
 A formula will automatically switch to an 
\family typewriter
\series medium
eqnarray
\family default
\series default
 format (LaTeX's multi-line displayed equation format) if you hit 
\family sans
\series medium
C-E
\series default
nter
\family default
.
 The best way to do this, if you decide you want a multi-line displayed
 equation, is to insert a new line (with 
\family sans
\series medium
C-Enter
\family default
\series default
) immediately.
 Each line then has three regions, left, center, and right, which you can
 move through using either the arrow keys, the mouse, or the 
\family sans
\series medium
Tab
\family default
\series default
 key.
 Here is an example:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray*}
3 & = & 1+2\\
4+5 & = & 9.\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

You can also turn an existing displayed formula into a multi-line formula
 by hitting 
\family sans
\series medium
C-Enter
\family default
\series default
 while the cursor is anywhere on the original formula.
 However, LyX will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 try to decide where to break the formula up into three parts, but places
 everything in the left side of the line.
 To change the alignment points of the equation, place the cursor where
 you want to start the middle part of the line, and hit 
\family sans
C-Tab.
 
\family default
It then puts everything to the right of the cursor in the middle region
 of the equation (which, by the way, is not typeset by LaTeX in display-math
 size, so you should not put large expressions like fractions there).
 Move to where you want the right side of the line to begin, and hit 
\family sans
C-Tab
\family default
 again.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extra
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 insertion points in the line will disappear.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Equation Numbering and Labels
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:math-label}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation numbering is very easy in LyX.
 All it takes to change a displayed equation like: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
1+2=3\]

\end_inset

into the numbered equation :
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
1+2=3\label{mathed:first-eqn}\end{equation}

\end_inset

is to go to the 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert
\family default
 menu, and select the 
\family sans
\bar under
L
\bar default
abel...

\family default
 option.
 This opens a dialog in which you must enter some string as the label.
 There is no need to call it by a specific number, since LaTeX will take
 care of re-numbering the equation.
 Labels will not appear as such on the final output.
 LaTeX will insert appropriate numbers for the equations.
 The labels are used internally for cross-referencing.
 You can turn on numbering without a specific label with the menu option

\end_inset

You can toggle it on or off with this menu item.
 You can reference a labelled (not just numbered) equation, (cf.
 (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{mathed:first-eqn}

\end_inset

)) by using the 
\family sans

\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

\family default

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For numbered (or labelled) multi-line formulas, the default is that all
 lines are numbered separately.
 Once you attach a label to make the equation numbered, all subsequent lines
 receive a label of #.
 That label can be changed to another so that you can refer to that line,
 like (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{mathed:third-eqn}

\end_inset

) below.
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
1 & = & 3-2\label{mathed:second-equation}\\
2 & = & 4-2\label{mathed:third-eqn}\\
4 & \leq & 7.\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

You can turn off numbering of a specific line with 
\family sans

E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
M
\bar default

Toggle\InsetSpace ~

\bar under

\family default
 while the cursor is on that line of a multi-line numbered equation.
 This also toggles.
 For example :
\begin_inset Formula \begin{eqnarray}
1 & = & 4-3\label{mathed:fourth-eqn}\\
2 & = & 7-5\\
1 & = & e^{2\pi i}\nonumber \\
16 & \equiv & 2\,(mod\,7)\label{mathed:fifth-eqn}\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Note that the first equation in this set (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{mathed:fourth-eqn}

\end_inset

) is labelled, the next is numbered but unlabelled, the third is unnumbered,
 and the last (
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{mathed:fifth-eqn}

\end_inset

) is again labelled.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
User defined macros in math mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX allows the user to define macros for use in math mode.
 A macro definition box appears on screen as purple box with the name of
 the macro in blue (math color).
 It contains two cells initially marked empty by blue rectangles that can
 be edited as if it were ordinary math.
 Just try it:
\begin_inset FormulaMacro
\newcommand{\macro}{a+b}
\end_inset

 The contents of the first cell will be used when the macro definition is
 written during export as LaTeX.
 The contents of the second cell, however, will be used for drawing the
 macro's expansion on screen.
 In the common case where both export and drawing use the same representation,
 the second cell can be left empty and LyX will use the contents of the
 first cell will be used for export and drawing automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, to use this macro in other math boxes just type the name in TeX mode,
 in this case 
\family typewriter

\backslash
macro
\family default
, and it will be automatically expanded: 
\begin_inset Formula $c=\macro$
\end_inset

.
 As you can verify, the cursor can't go inside the macro, the whole macro
 is like a single character, and the TeX generated code of this expression
 is 
\family typewriter
c = 
\backslash
macro.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However the cursor could go inside of some kind of macros, those that have
 
\emph on
arguments
\emph default
.
 In a macro definition box an argument looks like a 
\family typewriter
#
\family default
 followed by the argument number:
\begin_inset FormulaMacro
\newcommand{\macrowarg}[1]{2+\sqrt{#1}}
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once expanded, this macro includes the usual empty rectangle to indicate
 that you can insert there whatever you want: 
\family typewriter

\backslash
macrowarg = 
\begin_inset Formula $\macrowarg{}$
\end_inset


\family default
.
 Example: 
\begin_inset Formula $b=\macrowarg{x-2}$

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX's math mode does not support all characters in all fonts, and only
 letters will be supported with these font styles; some only support capital
 letters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any of these fonts, you have to be careful how you enter the text.
 If there is text to the right of the entry point, the font reverts to that
 style after one character.
 To be able to type a string in a particular font, make sure there is a
 protected-space to the right of the cursor.
 Also, entering a protected-space will revert subsequent text to standard
 font.
 The font styles are nestable, as LaTeX does.
 This can be a little confusing, as selecting a different font on a selection
 will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 change the selection, but insert a new nested level with the new typeface.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is possible (in AMS-LaTeX) to embolden (not italicize) numbers and special
 symbols.
 However, LyX does not yet support this in WYSIWYM manner\SpecialChar \@.
 It will print
 correctly, though.
 To get emboldened symbols, for example a bold 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, enter 
\family typewriter

\backslash
boldsymbol{
\backslash
alpha}
\family default
 in Mathed.
 The closing brace appears (in red) automatically when you type the opening
 brace.
 This works for all symbols, as well as numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Math Text Mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typefaces are useful for entering variable names in some given font, but
 certainly not for anything else, and in particular not text.
 For typing longer pieces of text, use math text mode, which is obtained
 by typing 
\family sans
M-m m
\family default
 while already in math mode.
 (The same command will get out of math text mode, too.) Math text mode appears
 on the screen in black instead of blue.
 You cannot enter punctuation or font changes in your text
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, math text mode outputs its contents inside a 
\family typewriter

\backslash
textrm{}
\family default
, whereas and 
\family typewriter

\backslash
mbox
\family default
 (or AMS-LaTeX's 
\backslash

\family typewriter
text
\family default
) might have been a better choice
\end_layout

\end_inset

, but it works for simple text.
 Here's an example:
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(x)=\begin{array}{cc}
x & \textrm{if I say so}\\
-x & \textrm{otherwise}\end{array}\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Font Sizes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four (relative) font sizes (or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

styles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) used in math-mode, which are automatically chosen in most situations.
 These are called 
\emph on
textstyle
\emph default
, 
\emph on
displaystyle
\emph default
, 
\emph on
scriptstyle
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
scriptscriptstyle
\emph default
.
 For most characters, 
\emph on
textstyle
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
displaystyle
\emph default
 are actually the same size, but fractions, superscripts and subscripts,
 and certain other effects, are set larger or placed differently in 
\emph on
displaystyle
\emph default
.
 Except for some operators, which re-size themselves to accommodate various
 situations, all text will be set in these various sizes as LaTeX thinks
 is appropriate.
 These choices can be over-ridden by using the 
\family typewriter
math-size
\family default
 function in the minibuffer.
 For example, you can set 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 normally (
\emph on
textstyle
\emph default
), or you can make it larger, which also changes the line-spacing, by entering
 
\family typewriter
math-size displaystyle
\family default
 in the minibuffer while the cursor is in the main line of the math-inset,
 
\begin_inset Formula ${\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 Careful, though, if the cursor is on the denominator of that fraction,
 only the numerator will be enlarged, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

! This reflects a LaTeX 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unintended feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
That is, a bug.
\end_layout

\end_inset

, not a LyX one.
 These font-size changes are not as apparent in LyX as they are in the output.
 Here are some text in the various styles: 
\begin_inset Formula $displaystyle$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\textstyle textstyle}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptstyle scriptstyle}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula ${\scriptscriptstyle scriptscriptstyle}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these math-mode font sizes are relative, that is, if the whole math
 inset and surrounding text are set in a particular size, all these sizes
 will be adjusted.
 Similarly, if the base font size of the document is changed, all fonts
 will be adjusted to correspond.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
AMS-Symbols
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The AMS-LaTeX packages add support for some mathematical symbols that are
 not accessible from plain LaTeX (or LyX), but are fairly common in mathematical
 typesetting, such as the old-German Fraktur font and the stylized 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

blackboard bold
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 fonts commonly used to denote the real or complex numbers, or the integers.
 Once activated, all AMS-LaTeX symbols and environments are available.
 You will run into trouble if you include these packages from the preamble,
 since LyX now defines a few of the macros used in these packages on its
 own.
 The AMS-layouts include these packages automatically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
AMS-Formula Types
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
AMS-LaTeX provides a selection of different formula types.
 LyX allows you to choose between

Cross-References

\begin_layout Standard
Those of you reading this manual online will see a grey box with text in
 it, right before the beginning of this sentence.
 This is a 
\family sans
Label
\family default

 Properly speaking, it is one half of a cross-reference.
 The other half is the 
\family sans

\family default
 proper, and it looks like this: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:crossref}

\end_inset

.
 Again, those of you reading the manual online will see a gray box with
 text in it.
 Those reading printed versions, however, will see a number --- in this
 case, the number of this section.
 There are also other varieties of cross-reference: for example, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \pageref{sec:crossref}

\end_inset

.
 This is the page number containing the location of the label.
 That's what cross-references do: they let you reference other parts of
 your document.
 You don't need to remember which section number was what anymore --- LyX
 will do that for you! All you need to do is use a 
\family sans

 to mark a section, figure, table, formula, etc., and then refer to it via
 a

\begin_layout Standard
Note that if you cut & paste text from another document that contains a

You'll also see two question marks in the output instead of the reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a few more comments we need to make about the 
\family sans
Labels
\family default
.
 They always print the number of the section heading closest to them.
 So --- if you want to put a label on a 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
, but a 
\family sans
Section
\family default
 heading immediately follows it, you need to put the 
\family sans
Label
\family default
 
\emph on
into
\emph default
 the 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 environment.
 It doesn't matter where, and it will look weird on the LyX screen.
 However, you need to do this if you want to label the 
\family sans
Chapter
\family default
 separately from the 
\family sans
Section
\family default
.
 The same goes for all other section headings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also, a 
\family sans
Label
\family default
 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 makes sense in 
\emph on
numbered
\emph default
 section headings and table and figure floats.
 Bare figures and tables aren't numbered, so, like unnumbered section headings,
 you can't really use a 
\family sans
Label
\family default
 on it.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
Well, you

 The regular

\family default

 because there's no numbered thingy to refer to! You could also use bare

 Once again, the regular

 It will refer to something, but that something will typically be the number
 of the previous numbered section heading.

It is often desirable to include long

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 items in a document such as Web site URLs, e-mail addresses, etc.; these
 things typically do not contain any spaces and are thus difficult to typeset
 properly.
 Such items will often fall on a line boundary if they cannot be split,
 resulting in an overfull or underfull line depending on the circumstances.
 You can use 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

 within LyX to enter a long URL and have it split gracefully (if necessary)

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes you wish to be able to output to paper multiple versions of the
 same document.
 The most extreme version of this is, when you want to prepare a single
 document in two or more different languages, but as a single document file,
 with corresponding pieces of text adjacent in the file and on-screen.
 This can be achieved with 
\emph on
branches
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, you have to 
\emph on
define 
\emph default
the branches available within a particular document.
 This is done in the 
\family sans
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Settings\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Branches
\family default
 tab.
 You can also associate a background colour with each branch, e.g., red for
 the English language, blue for the German language branch.
 Then, you create a branch inset from the 
\family sans
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Branch
\family default
 menu item.
 The inset will contain the text that you want to be output when this branch
 is activated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

LyX will generate previews of math insets.
 It will also generate previews of include insets or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

child documents
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if you select the 
\family sans
\bar under
S
\bar default
how\InsetSpace ~
preview

 check box in the inset's dialog.
 This latter is useful if you wish to generate a preview of a LaTeX figure,
 for example.
 Coming in version 1.4 are previews of the external inset also.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To get previews working, you'll need some additional software.
 First, you'll need the preview.sty LaTeX package.
 Find it on your local CTAN mirror at 
\newline

\family typewriter
CTAN/support/preview-latex/
\family default
.
 Thereafter, you'll need the usual tools: 
\family typewriter
latex
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
dvips
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
gs
\family default
.Finally, you'll obtain prettier results if you install 
\family typewriter
pnmcrop
\family default
from the 
\family typewriter
netpbm
\family default
 package.

Extra Horizontal Space
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:hspace}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family sans
HFill
\family default
s are a special LyX feature for adding extra space in a uniform fashion.
 An 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
 is actually a variable length space, whose length always equals the remaining
 space between the left and right margins.
 If there is more than one 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
 on a line, they divide the available space equally between themselves.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note: if an 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
 is at the beginning of a line, and it's 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
the first line in a paragraph, LyX ignores it.
 This prevents 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
s from accidentally being wrapped onto a new line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 Here a few examples what you can do with them:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
\noindent

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That was an example in the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 environment.
 Here:
\hfill
:is one in a standard paragraph.
 It may or may not be apparent in the printed text, but it 
\emph on
is
\emph default
 sitting in-between the two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember that we said that an 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
 always fills the remaining space between the margins? There may be more
 than one set of margins on a line.
 Here's an example with the 
\family sans
List
\family default
 environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Labeling

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 marks the beginning of the item.
 (There is actually a

hidden
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\family sans

 inside of the label of the 
\family sans

 situations, like two-column mode.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Extra Vertical Space
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:vertspace}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To add extra vertical space above or below a paragraph, use 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
aragraph\InsetSpace ~
Settings
\family default
 to open the 
\family sans
Paragraph\InsetSpace ~
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will not provide an example of a 
\family sans
VFill
\family default
, as it would waste paper.
 They work the same as any other type of filler, including 
\family sans
HFill
\family default
s: they fill the remaining vertical space on a page with blank space.
 If there are several 
\family sans
VFill
\family default
s on a page, they divide the remaining vertical space equally between themselves.
 You can therefore use 
\family sans
VFill
\family default
s to center text on a page, or even place text 2/3 down a page, or 1/4,
 and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for paragraphs at the top/bottom of a page, the extra space is
 only added if you have also checked the option 
\family sans
\bar under
E

\begin_layout Subsection
Changing Paragraph Alignment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also change the paragraph alignment with the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
aragraph\InsetSpace ~
Settings
\family default
 dialog.
 There are four possibilities: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
\bar under
J
\bar default
ustified
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
\bar under
L
\bar default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
\bar under
R
\bar default
ight
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family sans
\bar under
C
\bar default
enter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default in most cases is justified alignment, in which the inter-word
 spacing is variable and each line of a paragraph fills the region between
 the left and right margins.
 The other three alignments should be self-explanatory, and look like this:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align right
This paragraph is right aligned,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
this one is centered,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
this one is left aligned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some paragraph environments, the default is something other than justified
 alignment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Forcing Page Breaks
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:pagebreak}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you don't like the way LaTeX does the page breaks in your document, you
 can force a pagebreak where you want one.
 In general, this will 
\emph on
not 
\emph default
be necessary because LaTeX is good at pagebreaking, as was already mentioned
 in section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:widows}

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So in general there is no need to use the option described below, and we
 recommend not using it until the text is
\emph on
 
\emph default
finished, and until you have checked in the preview to see if you 
\emph on
really 
\emph default
have to change the pagebreaking.You can force a pagebreak above or below
 a paragraph in the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
P
\bar default
aragraph\InsetSpace ~
Settings
\family default
 dialog by selecting the checkboxes to add a pagebreak above or below the
 paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You might try to use a pagebreak to ensure that a figure or table appears
 at the top of a page.
 This is, of course, the wrong way to do it.
 LyX gives you a way of automatically ensuring that your figures and tables
 appear at the top of a page [or the bottom, or on their own page] without
 having to worry about what precedes or follows your figure or table.
 See sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:figures}

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:tables}

\end_inset

 and read about 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Blanks/Spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A blank is a blank? Not in good typography.
 While you might be used to press the space key anytime you want to separate
 two words in ordinary word processors, LyX offers you more spaces: Spaces
 of different width and spaces which can or cannot be broken at the end
 of a line.
 The following sections will show you some examples where those spaces are
 useful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Inter-word Space
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:normblank-lbreak-horline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some languages (e.\InsetSpace \thinspace{}
g.\InsetSpace \space{}
English) have the typographical convention to add extra
 space after an end-of-sentence punctuation mark, and LyX honors those conventio
ns (see section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:abbrev}

\end_inset

).
 Sometimes, you want a normal space nevertheless.
 In this case, insert one with 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Special\InsetSpace ~
F
\bar under
o
\bar default
rmatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Inter-

\family default
or with 
\family sans
C-M-Space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Protected Space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:protblank-lbreak-horline}

\end_inset

The protected space: It is used to tell LyX (and LaTeX) not to break the
 line at that point.
 This may be necessary to avoid unlucky linebreaks, like in: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
A good documentation should weight no more than 1
\newline
kg.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously, it would be a good thing to put a protected space between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

1
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

kg
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A protected space is set with 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Special\InsetSpace ~
F
\bar under
o
\bar default
rmatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Protected
\bar under
\InsetSpace ~
S
\bar default
pace 
\family default
or with 
\family sans
C-Space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Thin Space
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:thinblank-lbreak-horline}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thin space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a blank which has half the size of a normal space (and it is also 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

protected
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
 The typographical conventions in a lot of languages propose the use of
 thin spaces in cases where normal spaces would be too wide, for instance
 inside abbreviations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
D.\InsetSpace \thinspace{}
E.
 Knuth has developped our beloved typesetting program, i.\InsetSpace \thinspace{}
e.\InsetSpace \space{}
TeX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can insert a thin space with 
\family sans
\bar under
I
\bar default
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Special\InsetSpace ~
F
\bar under
o
\bar default
rmatting\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
T
\bar default
hin\InsetSpace ~
Space 
\family default
or with 
\family sans
C-S-Space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
More Spaces
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the ones described, there are still some more spaces.
 Although LyX supports them natively, they can only be reached via the 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 To get them, just type 
\family typewriter
space-insert <command>
\family default
 into the minibuffer, where

 You should, however, not use this to correct LaTeX's linebreaking, as LaTeX
 is 
\emph on
very 
\emph default
good at linebreaking\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 (see section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:pagebreak}

\end_inset

).
 There are, however, a number of situations where it is necessary to actively
 set a linebreak, e.g.
 in a poem or for an Address (see sections 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:quote}

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:verse}

\begin_layout Section
Spellchecking
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:spellchecking}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX itself has no built-in spellchecker.
 Rather it uses the external 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
 program as a backend or the newer and generally better 
\family typewriter
aspell
\family default
.
 This section assumes you have already installed and set up one of these
 programs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spellchecker can be started with the menu entry 
\family sans
\bar under
T
\bar default
ools
\bar under
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\shape up
S
\bar default
pellchecker
\family default
\shape default
.
 Checking will start just after the current cursor position.
 A dialog window will appear showing any incorrect (or unknown) word found,
 allowing you to edit and replace it in a second line.
 Whenever an unknown word is found, the word is highlighted and the view
 in your text buffer is updated to make the word visible.
 In the 
\family sans
Spellchecker
\family default
 dialog, there is also a box showing suggestions for a correction, if any
 could be found.
 Clicking on one of the corrections will copy the near miss into the replace
 input field (double-click to invoke replace).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Dictionary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default, the dictionary file to use is determined by the language of
 the text you're checking, which is set in the
\family sans

\shape default
\bar under
D
\bar default
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings

 If you do not have a dictionary for the document language, the spellchecker
 will not work.
 In this case, you can specify another dictionary file in the dialog by
 specifying a different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

alternative language
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you're using 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
, you may need to make a link from say 
\family typewriter
deutsch.(aff|hash)
\family default
 to 
\family typewriter
german.(aff|hash)
\family default
 or whatever applies for your language.
 This is because these 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
 files normally have the native language name (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

deutsch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) whereas 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
, when started from LyX, searches for the English version of the name used
 with the LaTeX babel package (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

german
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You may also have problems the font encoding is not correct for that dictionary.
 If you use a language with 
\family typewriter
latin1
\family default
 encoding and set the 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
ncoding
\family default
 option in the 
\family sans

\bar under
S
\bar default
ettings
\family default
 dialog to 
\family sans
latin1
\family default
 (or other than 
\family sans
default
\family default
), you must have this option in your language dictionary as well.
 If your dictionary doesn't support the 
\family sans
Encoding
\family default
 you chose, you'll have an error like this on stderr:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
ispell: unrecognized formatter type 'latin1'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The spellchecker gives you an error that it couldn't start the 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
 process and that you probably have some problems with your dictionary file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are four solutions to this problem.
 The easiest is to try the 
\family sans
Use\InsetSpace ~
Input\InsetSpace ~
Encoding
\family default
 option.
 If that does not help, you can set 
\family sans
\bar under
E
\bar default
ncoding
\family default
 to 
\family sans
default
\family default
 when calling the spellchecker (which is probably annoying).
 The third is to add the 
\family typewriter
latin1
\family default
 option to your dictionary 
\family typewriter
\emph on
<
\family default
language
\family typewriter
>
\emph default
.aff
\family default
 file and recompile the dictionary (which probably isn't easy if you installed
 the whole stuff with some distribution and don't have the language directory
 of the 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
 sources).
 Read the 
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
 documentation for this task! The fourth is to send a message to your package-ma
intainer, or better yet to the maintainer of the dictionary file in question
 and ask him to solve your problem.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Personal dictionary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you want to use a different file from the spellchecker's default choice
 as your personal dictionary, you can set this in the dialog.
 Specifying a filename which does not already exist will result in an error
 message on stderr which you can ignore (
\family typewriter
ispell
\family default
 will create the file when you finish checking your spelling).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\newline
Allows you to add nonstandard characters to what the spellchecker considers
 words, e.g.
 German umlauts.
 This should not normally be needed.

\begin_layout Subsection
Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some users have expressed a wish to be able to globally change the spelling
 of a particular word, rather than having to change the spelling separately
 for each occurrence of the word.
 Per-document word lists would also be useful.
 Neither of these features are present as of this writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unless you're using the 
\family typewriter
pspell
\family default
 spellchecker, LyX cannot correctly spellcheck documents containing multiple
 languages.
 This, does, however, work with 
\family typewriter
pspell
\family default
, assuming you have marked the different languages appropriately.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
International Support
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section describes how to use LyX with any language you want.
 LyX comes with a default configuration which supports the English language
 on a U.S.-style keyboard, with a standard U.S.
 paper size and the spellchecker set to U.S.
 English.
 You can change any or all of these settings as desired, and you can make
 the changes apply to the current session only, or use them as your new
 default configuration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have a keyboard suited to the language you are using (for example,
 a German keyboard for writing in German), and you have correctly configured
 your X environment, all you need to do for LyX is tell it your language,
 the character encoding, and desired paper size.
 Refer to 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:langlay}

\end_inset

 for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If, however, you have a U.S.-style keyboard and want to write in a different
 language than English, you can use an alternate keymap.
 For example, if you have a U.S.-style keyboard but want to write in Italian,
 you can configure LyX to use an Italian keymap.
 Refer to 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:optkey}

\end_inset

 for details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, you may just want to change a few key mappings or create an entirely
 different keymap (for Vulcan, for instance).
 You may, for example, normally write in Italian on a U.S.
 keyboard but want to include an occasional quotation in German.
 In such a case, you can write your own keyboard mapping or modify an existing
 one to support the characters you want.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The details of how to customize LyX to your own language are 
\emph on
way
\emph default
 beyond the scope of this manual.
 You can not only alter the keyboard layout, you can also change the names
 of the menus buttons, etc., to reflect your language.
 If you want to learn more about writing keymap files and tailoring LyX
 to your native tongue, please see the 
\emph on
Customization
\emph default
 manual for details.

There are a few things you need to know about this table.
 This manual is set up --- by hand, mind you --- to print all of these character
s.
 That ain't the default.
 Nowhere near, in fact.
 Here are some of the details you'll need to bear in mind when using characters
 from the 
\family typewriter
Latin1
\family default
 character set:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The characters at entries A2, A4, A5, A6 and AD -- the cent, the yen, the
 generic-currency-symbol, the broken vertical bar and the short dash are
 just plain missing in the default encodings.
 We don't know where they are or why this is the case.
