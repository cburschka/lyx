Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This manual documents some aspects of \SpecialChar LyX
 development.
 It is currently rather incomplete, but will hopefully be extended in the
 future.
 Meanwhile, additional information can be found in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
development
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subfolder of the \SpecialChar LyX
 source code distribution.
 This document is not translated, since the development language of \SpecialChar LyX
 is
 English.
 If you just want to use \SpecialChar LyX
, then you don't need to read this manual.
 However, if you want to learn more about how \SpecialChar LyX
 is developed, or even want
 to participate in \SpecialChar LyX
 development, you may find some interesting information
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
File formats
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 uses several custom file formats for configuration files and documents.
 This chapter contains some background concerning these file formats.
 Several file formats are also described in detail in the regular user documenta
tion.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you are working on a new feature you may ask yourself whether it needs
 an update of the .lyx file format number.
 Whether an update is needed or not is not always obvious.
 Below you can find a list of reasons for file format updates with explanations:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
New
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

document
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

setting Whenever you introduce a new setting that is stored in the document
 header, a file format update is needed.
 This is also true if you add a new valid value to an existing setting,
 e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

a new language that is stored in 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

setting If a certain setting becomes obsolete and gets removed, a file format
 update is needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
New

\end_inset

style If a new style or inset layout is added to any layout file or module
 shipped with \SpecialChar LyX
, then a new file format is needed in the master (development)
 branch.
 It is possible to backport new styles to the stable version without a file
 format change.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Backporting-new-styles"

\end_inset

 for more information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description

Automatically

\end_inset

loaded
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

math
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

package Any new math package that is automatically loaded needs a file format
 update.
 The reason for this is that there is no true ERT inset for math formulas:
 Each command is parsed, and if a user happens to define a local command
 with the same name as a command that triggers an automatic load of a package,
 they need to be able to switch off the automatic loading of that package.
 This switch is stored by the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 header setting.

How to update the file format number of .lyx files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you come to the conclusion that a file format update is needed, you
 should use the following procedure to perform the update:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Implement and test the new feature, including the reading and writing of
 .lyx files.
 Note that any file produced at this stage does not use a valid format,
 so do not use this version of \SpecialChar LyX
 for working on any important documents.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lib/lyx2lyx/lyx_2_3.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Add a conversion routine if needed (e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g., a new header setting always needs a conversion that adds the new setting,
 but a new document language does not need one).
 Add a reversion routine if needed.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

While the conversion routine is required to produce a document that is equivalen
t to the old version, the requirements of the reversion are not that strict.
 If possible, try to produce a proper reversion, using ERT if needed, but
 for some features this might be too complicated.
 In this case, the minimum requirement of the reversion routine is that
 it produces a valid document which can be read by an older \SpecialChar LyX
.
 If absolutely needed, even data loss is allowed for the reversion.
 (In that case, you might want to add a LyX comment that indicates what
 you have had to do, so the user is at least warned).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since tex2lyx has several implicit file format dependencies caused by sharing
 code with \SpecialChar LyX
, updating the file format of .lyx files produced by tex2lyx at
 the same time as updating the main .lyx file format is strongly recommended.
 Therefore, a compiler warning will be issued if the \SpecialChar LyX
 and tex2lyx .lyx file
 format numbers differ.
 In many cases the tex2lyx update requires only the first and last item
 of the list below:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Update the tex2lyx file format number in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/version.h
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the lyx2lyx conversion from the old to the new format is empty, or if
 tex2lyx does not yet output the changed feature, you do not need any further
 tex2lyx changes.
 Otherwise, search for the changed feature in tex2lyx, and adjust the output
 according to the lyx2lyx changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Update the tex2lyx test references as described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "sec:Updating-test-references"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
If you did not implement full tex2lyx support for the new feature, add a
 line to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/TODO.txt
\end_layout

\end_inset

 describing the missing bits.
 Note that it is perfectly fine if you do not add full tex2lyx support for
 a new feature: The updating recommendation above is only issued for the
 syntax of the produced .lyx file.
 It is no problem if some features supported by \SpecialChar LyX
 are still output as ERT
 by tex2lyx.
 The problems in the past that resulted in the update recommendation were
 related to mixed version syntax, not ERT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
It would be nice if you could create a .lyx test file which contains instances
 of all changed or added features.
 This could then be used to test lyx2lyx and tex2lyx.
 Unfortunately, it has not yet been decided how to collect such examples,
 so please ask on the development list if you want to create one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "enu:updatefiles"

\end_inset

Update LyX's .lyx documentation files to the new format.
 The developer who makes the change knows best what changes to expect when
 inspecting the resulting diff.
 Because of this, you might be able to catch a bug in the lyx2lyx code that
 updates the format just by taking a quick scan through the large diff that
 is the result.
\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Another advantage is that if later we suspect a bug in lyx2lyx we can easily
 see which layout update made an unexpected change by looking at the git
 log of a .lyx file that suffers the problem.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 To do this, first make sure that there are no changes to the git repository
 that you will not want to commit (this is needed because it will be convenient
 to commit with the command 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
git commit -a
\end_layout

\end_inset

).
 Then run the following command in the root folder of the source: 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
python development/tools/updatedocs.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Look at the resulting changes using the command 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
git diff
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 If anything looks surprising, please investigate.
 Keep in mind that the case of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
LFUNs.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is special, because it is first generated with 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
gen_lfuns.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

 before being converted to the latest format.
 Finally, commit using 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
git commit -a
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Updating the file format number of layout files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure for updating the layout files is similar to that in step 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:updatefiles"

\end_inset

 in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:update_lyx_files"

\end_inset

.

\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
updatedocs.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that we do not automatically any local layout used in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files shipped with \SpecialChar LyX
 because users would then not be able to export to older
 formats.
 For example, if a 2.2.0 user exported a template to 2.1.x format and tried
 to open the file in \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, there would be an error because the file would
 contain a local layout whose format is too new.
 The root reason for this is that we do not support converting layouts to
 older layout formats, as we do for the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Updating the file format number of bind/ui files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A change to the functionality of existing LFUNs can require a conversion
 of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.bind
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 files, and therefore an increment of the LFUN format, as well as a conversion
 of Info insets in 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files for manuals.
 The latter cannot be done automatically and also requires an update of
 the \SpecialChar LyX
 file format.
 (Think e.g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

of someone who might have made a set of \SpecialChar LyX
 teaching manuals for use in their
 own group.)

Backporting new styles to the stable version
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Backporting-new-styles"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with the stable \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1 branch, there is a mechanism in place to backport
 new styles to the stable version without the need to update the file format.
 The basic idea is that the new style definition is automatically copied
 to the document preamble so that it can even be used by older minor versions
 that did not yet include the style.
 To backport a new style to the stable version, the following steps are
 needed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Add the line 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ForceLocal -1
\end_layout

\end_inset

 to the style definition in the development version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Copy the style definition to the stable version, but use 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ForceLocal 1
\end_layout

\end_inset

 instead.
 If needed adjust the format to the one used by the stable version (see
 the customization manual for details of the layout file format).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For each update of the style in a later stable version, increase the argument
 of 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ForceLocal
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by one.
 (In the stable version, the development version should not be touched.)

 flag see the customization manual.
 No 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lyx2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 support is needed for backported styles: Since the style of the development
 version has an infinite version number, it will always be used.
 Furthermore, since its version number is less than one, the style will
 not be written anymore to the document header for files saved by the new
 version.

 You should therefore think carefully about whether you really want to do
 this and discuss it on lyx-devel, since you will need to be prepared to

 it may be better to add it to the relevant portion of the \SpecialChar LyX

\begin_layout Itemize
We have the same situation already with custom layout files: If a document
 using a custom layout file is moved between machines or people, then the

 can still be edited, but not exported, and the user gets a warning.

\begin_layout Subsection
New modules
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Adding a new module is very similar to adding a new layout.
 Therefore, the previous section applies to new modules as well, with two
 exceptions: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You only need to add an entry to 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
lib/doc/LaTeXConfig.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 if the module requires a LaTeX package.
 In that case, the command for entering the InsetInfo is: 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\paragraph_spacing single
info-insert package <name>
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Modules do not need a template, only an example, which is strongly encouraged
 but not necessarily required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Layouts for document classes with incompatible versions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every now and then, there are changes to LaTeX document classes that break
 backwards compatibility.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Uwe has suggested we implement automatic detection of changes in class files.
 This could be done by running a script every month that checks if a document
 class was changed at CTAN and at the homepages of the scientific journals.
 If it reports a change, we can check if our template and layout file are
 still usable with the changed document class.
 (This is different from the autotests insofar, as this would also catch
 changes that do not result in compilation errors.)
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Reasons can be a new name for the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
*.cls
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file, removed \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands, or both.
 How should this best be handled in \SpecialChar LyX
? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is to support the new version with a new \SpecialChar LyX
 layout so that:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Existing documents can still be opened in \SpecialChar LyX
 and will continue to work on
 systems where the old version is still installed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With differently named 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
*.cls
\end_layout

\end_inset

 files, \SpecialChar LyX
 can check for the availability of the particular version and reflect
 this in the GUI.
 Different document class versions with the same file name are currently
 (2.2.x) not detected by the configuration script.
 This is planned for 2.3.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
https://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org/msg192467.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, what we really need is version detection for the configuration,
 so that the user can be warned if the required class file has the wrong
 version.
 (If the class file keeps the name over the version change, only one of
 the two layout files generates compilable documents.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This point was also made here: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.editors.lyx.devel/143

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, because the layout file is completely new, it can be added both
 to the master and the stable branches, in accord with the policy discussed
 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand formatted
reference "subsec:New-layouts"

\end_inset

.
 No lyx2lyx conversion is then required when a new major version is released.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user can then move an existing document to the new version simply by
 selecting a new document class.
 This step is well supported by \SpecialChar LyX
, with established methods for handling
 unsupported styles and other changes.
 This way, no lyx2lyx code is required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The steps to support a new version of an existing document class are thus:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Create a new layout file including the upstream version in the name (avoid
 special characters like spaces and dots), e.g.
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
acmsiggraph-v0-92.layout
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Include the name of the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
*.cls
\end_layout

\end_inset

 file as an optional argument in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass
\end_layout

\end_inset

 line and include the version number in the GUI name:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass[acmsiggraph]{ACM SIGGGRAPH (v.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

0.92)}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Update the GUI name in the old layout file (whose name should not have been
 changed), e.g.:
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\backslash
DeclareLaTeXClass{ACM SIGGRAPH (<= v.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

0.91, obsolete)}
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
To avoid duplicate definitions, the new layout can 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 the old layout file and add\SpecialChar breakableslash
remove\SpecialChar breakableslash

modify settings and styles (similar
 to inclusion of 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_inset

 files).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
It may be tempting to let the new layout be the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

master version
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and have the old layout import it.
 However, this should not be done because any changes to the new layout
 would need undo steps in the importing old layout.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
If the new LaTeX document class obsoletes the old one, update the example
 and template files to use the new layout.
 Add a note about the changes (preferably with a pointer to the documentation
 of the changes).
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
This way, new documents based on the template or example will use the up-to-date
 document class version.

\begin_layout Section
Tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Automated tests are an important tool to detect bugs and regressions in
 software development.
 Some projects like gcc even require each bug fix to be accompanied by a
 test case for the automatic test suite, that would detect this bug.
 Testing interactive features automatically is of course very hard, but
 core functionality like document import and export can be tested quite
 easily, and some tests of this kind exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
unit tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are attempts to set up a suite of unit tests for LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
TODO: describe what is done and what is still to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
tex2lyx tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tex2lyx tests are located in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subfolder of the \SpecialChar LyX
 source code distribution.
 The actual testing is performed by the simple python script 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test/runtests.py
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 Each test consists of two files: 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<test name>.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 contains the \SpecialChar LaTeX
 code that should be tested.
 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<test name>.lyx.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 contains the expected output of tex2lyx.
 When a test is run, the actual produced output is compared with the stored
 reference output.
 The test passes if both are identical.
 The test machinery is also able to generate a file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
<test name>.lyx.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 by exporting the produced .lyx file with \SpecialChar LyX
 again.
 This may be useful for roundtrip comparisons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Running the tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tex2lyx tests can be run in several ways.
 When in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 subfolder of the build directory, the commands 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ctest
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (cmake, all platforms), 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
make test
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (cmake, when using a make based build system and not MSVC) or 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
make alltests
\end_layout

\end_inset

 (autotools) will run the tex2lyx tests.
 Alternatively, in the root of the build directory, the command 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ctest -R tex2lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 runs all tests whose names match the regex 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tex2lyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Another way to run the tex2lyx tests in the root build directory is to
 instead use the command 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ctest -L '(cmplyx|roundtrip)'
\end_layout

\end_inset

, which runs all tests categorized with the label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

roundtrip
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cmplyx
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If a test fails, the differences between the expected and actual results
 are output in unified diff format.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases a changed tex2lyx output is not a test failure, but wanted,
 e.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

if a tex2lyx bug was fixed, or a new feature was added.
 In these cases the stored references need to be updated.
 To do so if using autotools, call 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Standard
For convenience, these commands also produce re-exported roundtrip .lyx.tex

 .lyx 
\begin_inset Formula $\Rightarrow$
\end_inset

 .tex, and does not compare the produced dvi or pdf output, it assumes that
 the stored .lyx reference produces correct output if processed by \SpecialChar LyX
.
 There is only one chance to detect wrong output: before committing a new
 reference.
 Once it is committed, it is quite difficult to verify whether it is correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Please 
\emph on
do not
\emph default
 update the test references by opening them with \SpecialChar LyX
 or directly running lyx2lyx
 on them.
 This would not work, since lyx2lyx and \SpecialChar LyX
 produce slightly different files
 regarding insignificant whitespace and line breaks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Adding a new test
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many cases tests for new features may be added to one of the existing
 test files, but sometimes this is not possible or not wanted.
 Then a new test file needs to be added:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Create the new file 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test/<test name>.tex
\end_layout

\end_inset

 and run tex2lyx in roundtrip mode to produce the file 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
src/tex2lyx/test/<test name>.lyx.lyx
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This file will be the new reference.

Export tests

 They take longer to run and are more likely to break than the tex2lyx tests.
 Nevertheless, they have caught many regressions and without a better alternativ

Expectations of LyX developers

Because the export tests are integration tests and take a long time to run,
 LyX developers are rarely expected to run all of the tests.
 Here are some good practices to follow by developers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
When making a non-trivial change to a .layout file, run the export and layout
 tests corresponding with that .layout file.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

no test will fail due to ongoing work on documentation,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To run all tests, in the build directory simply run the command 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\begin_layout Plain Layout
ctest
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 A full, up-to-date TeXLive installation is recommended to run the tests.
 Otherwise, some tests will fail.
 Tests with additional requirements are labeled

\begin_layout Standard
To run only some of the tests, use command line options (see examples below):
\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Run the tests in parallel using the given number of jobs.
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
We are still working on getting the tests to run in parallel.
 However, when running the tests in parallel, sometimes tests fail that
 pass when run sequentially.
 A reasonable approach is to first run the tests in parallel and then run
 the failed tests sequentially.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, to run 8 jobs at a time:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

When specifying a subset of the tests (e.g.
 using 
\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar nobreakdash

\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
\SpecialChar nobreakdash

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the .lyx files are exported in several formats, it is not surprising
 that many of the exports fail.
 This expectation of failure is addressed by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inverting

 the tests, that is, by marking the test as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\emph on

 It follows that these expected failures will not show up as failed tests
 in the test results and thus will not pollute the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 tests.
 If the export actually succeeds, then the test will fail.
 The purpose of this failure is to get your attention—something has changed,
 possibly for the better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We try to document why a test is inverted or ignored.
 See the comment (prefixed with 
\begin_inset Flex Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A good question is why do we enable the tests for non-default formats? The
 answer is that if a non-default route is broken it is often because a bug
 was introduced in LyX and not because a document-specific change was made
 that is not supported by the route.
 In other words, there is a high signal/noise ratio in the export tests
 for some non-default formats.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a test or several tests fail, consider checking the files in the 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 In this subdirectory are three files: the file

\begin_inset Flex Code
status collapsed

 why a test failed); and the

\begin_layout Subsubsection
check_load tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These tests check whether a .lyx file loads without any terminal messages.
 They correspond to the manual operations of simply opening a .lyx file on
 the terminal, exiting LyX once the file is loaded, and then checking whether
 there is any output from the terminal.
 These tests are useful for catching malformed .lyx files and parsing bugs.
 They can also be used to find a .lyx file in which an instance of something
 happens.
 To do this, compile LyX with a local patch that outputs something to the
 terminal when an instance is found, and then run the check_load tests to
 see if any fail, which would mean that the situation occurs in the LyX
 documentation files corresponding to the failed tests.
 These tests are expectedly fragile: any LyX diagnostic message, which is
 not necessarily an error, would cause the tests to fail.
 Similarly, any message output by a library (e.g.
 Qt) would also cause failure.
 There are some messages that the check_load tests are instructed to ignore,
 which are stored in the file 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 They fail if either fails.

The URL tests are enabled with the

 see the output in 
\begin_inset Flex Code

 These tests are extremely fragile (e.g.
 a test can depend on your Internet connection) and a failed URL test should
 not be taken too seriously.
 URL tests are labeled as

'url'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Running URL tests
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
cmake is required to run the \SpecialChar LyX
 tests, running them is not implemented for
 autotools.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The appropriate commands are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ctest -L url
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

runs all tests with label 
\family typewriter
'url'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\family typewriter
ctest -R 'check_.*urls'
\family default

\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

runs the tests 'check_accessible_urls'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Associated test results can be examined in ctest-log directory in files
 of the form 'LastFailed.*URLS.log'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
When to set a fixed milestone?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Only set a fixed milestone (like 2.1.4 or 2.2.0) if at least one of the following
 holds:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Somebody is actively working on a fix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The bug is so severe that it would block the release if it is not fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a bug is important, but nobody is working on it, and it is no showstopper,
 use a milestone like 2.1.x or 2.2.x.
 For all other bugs, do not set a milestone at all.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Can we add rc entries in stable branch?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No.
 We are supposed to increase the prefs2prefs version number with such things.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Documentation policies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main documentation consists of these files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
splash.lyx it is the first file you see after an installation.
 We assume that a new user sees this.
 It is therefore designed to be as simple as possible.
 Therefore please don't add any new formatting, only fix typos etc.
 Splash.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Intro.lyx This is the manual new users will read to learn \SpecialChar LyX
.
 It therefore uses a limited set of formatting.
 For example a standard document class.
 Since new users will first learn about the formatting possibilities of
 \SpecialChar LyX
 please keep this file that simple.
 Intro.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Tutorial.lyx our tutorial.
 It must be always up to date.
 Normally there is nothing to add since we don't want to overwhelm new users
 with too much details.
 The will learn these details while using \SpecialChar LyX
 and we have special manuals.
 Tutorial.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
UserGuide.lyx our main user guide.
 It covers a mixture of basic and detailed information.
 Some information is also in the Math and EmbeddedObjects manual so that
 the UserGuide refers to these files.
 UserGuide.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
EmbeddedObjects.lyx a special manual to explain things like tables floats
 boxes etc.
 in all detail.
 EmbeddedObjects.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe
 Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Math.lyx a special manual to explain everything regarding math in all detail.
 Math.lyx is up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x, currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Additional.lyx this manual covers information that would be too much detail
 for the UserGuide or would make the UserGuide uncompilable or only compilable
 when installing a lot of special \SpecialChar LaTeX
-packages.
 What should be in the UserGuide or better in Additional is a matter of
 taste.
 it is up to you to decide that.
 Additional.lyx is not completely up to date for \SpecialChar LyX
 2.1.x.
 Only chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

8 is up to date and currently maintained by Uwe Stöhr.
 It certainly needs a rewrite and update.
 For example many info in chapter
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2 and 3 are already covered by the UserGuide and/or the EmbeddedObjects
 manual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Customization.lyx this manual covers information how to customize \SpecialChar LyX
 for certain
 output formats, operating systems, languages etc.
 It is currently completely out of date and needs a major rewrite and update.
 If you do this please assure that your information are given for all OSes
 and \SpecialChar LaTeX
 distributions (meaning be as objective as possible).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are only 4
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

rules in editing the docs:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you are not the maintainer of a doc file or a chapter/section, you MUST
 use change tracking so that the maintainer could review your changes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Respect the formatting of the document.
 The different files use different formatting styles.
 That is OK and has historic reasons nobody fully know ;-).
 But it is important to be consistent within one file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
All changes you make to a file in one language MUST also go the file in
 the other actively maintained languages.
 Normally the maintainer does this for you, if you are the maintainer, you
 must do this by copying or changing the changed or added text to the other
 files so that the translators sees the blue underlined text and know what
 they have to translate and what was changed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You MUST assure that the document is compilable as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

PDF (pdflatex)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 after your changes.
\end_layout

\end_body
