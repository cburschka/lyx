\begin_layout Title
Documentation Project Style Sheet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
by John Weiss
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
This article is a style sheet.
 It describes, with examples, how the documentation should look and sound.
 The first few sections explain the font conventions and typography conventions
 all documentation writers should follow.
 Those sections also contain examples.
 It also explains the purpose of each of the different manuals.
 Follow it not merely to the letter, but also in spirit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The Style Sheet for \SpecialChar LyX
 documentation (hereafter known as the Style Sheet)
 applies to 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 forms of \SpecialChar LyX
 documenation, regardless of language.
 There is a section for translators in the Style Sheet, towards the end.
 
\emph on
Read the entire Style Sheet!
\emph default
 Even if you are a translator, I assume you know enough English to comprehend
 this document.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Questions and Clarifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the second version of this Style Sheet grew uncomfortably large, the
 \SpecialChar LyX
 DocTeam decided it needed to lose some excess weight.
 It seems the Style Sheet began to specify too many special cases, too many
 points of clarification.
 On the other hand, contributors to the documents were discovering many
 creative ways of misinterpreting the Style Sheet specifications.
 Therefore:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
If you have any questions about anything in the Style Sheet, 
\emph on
ask first, write second!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Field all questions to the \SpecialChar LyX
 Developer's Mailing List.
 There are seasoned DocTeam members who can answer your questions.
 If you have any problems with the Style Sheet itself, also contact the
 mailing list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Fonts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll start with the easiest section, yet also the most important.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is how you should fontify text in the manuals:
\end_layout

 and of their sections, and notes from the authors

 Rich Fields added this to mimick the underlining of letters in the menus

 It helps to highlight the accelerator keys, and human brains store information
 best when they see it frequently.

\begin_layout Description
WARNING! â€” When you do this, make sure you

\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
If you want to emphasize any text, use 
\emph on
Emphasized
\emph default
.
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 will put many things boldface on its own, such as 
\family sans
Section
\family default
s, certain parts of equations, et cetera.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Repeat: do not use boldface.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Here are some examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The function 
\family typewriter
math-mode
\family default
 appears in configuration files and in the \SpecialChar LyX
 source.
 Therefore, it (and all other \SpecialChar LyX
 function names) count as code and is set
 in 
\family typewriter
Typewriter
\family default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
However, 
\family sans
\bar under
M
\bar default
ath
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

mode
\family default
 is a menu item in the 
\family sans
\bar under
M
\bar default
ath
\family default
 menu, so it appears in 
\family sans
Sans
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Serif
\family default
.
 Notice the use of 
\family sans
\bar under
U
\bar default
nderlined
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Sans
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Serif
\family default
 for the accelerator keys.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Consider the following excerpt from the introduction of one of the manuals:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Quotation

\family sans
Return
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Enter
\family default
 both refer to the same key.
 Some keyboards label the 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 key as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Return,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 others as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Enter,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 still others have two keys.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 treats all of them as the same key, so we'll use 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 and 
\family sans
Enter
\family default
 interchangeably.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the key name, 
\family sans
Return
\family default
, is in 
\family sans
Sans
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Serif
\family default
, but 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 when it references the key itself! When I described how the manufacturer
 chose to label its keyboard, I used Roman and put the word in quotes.
 There is a semantic difference.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Take the following command:
\begin_inset Separator latexpar
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
lpr -P
\family default
\emph on
printername
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the argument to the 
\family typewriter
-P
\family default
 option is in 
\emph on
Roman Italics
\emph default
 (i.
\begin_inset space \thinspace{}
\end_inset

g.
 emphasized).
 This is a case where you don't use 
\family typewriter
Typewriter
\family default
 for code, because you want the generic argument label to stand out.
 On the other hand, if you were specifying an argument, for example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
lpr -Pduaneps
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you'd leave it in 
\family typewriter
Typewriter
\family default
.
 
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Enumerate
Any \SpecialChar LaTeX
 commands and code, and any 
\emph on
unsupported
\emph default
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 package names get set in 
\family typewriter
Typewriter
\family default
.
 For example, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family typewriter
multicol
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the name of an unsupported \SpecialChar LaTeX
 package, but 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family sans

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a supported \SpecialChar LaTeX
 class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Keys 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The canonical keyboard contains these keys:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 Even the word

\begin_layout Standard
I won't throw a hissy fit if you use one instead of the other.
 I'd prefer if you used 
\family sans
Return
\family default
 over 
\family sans
Enter
\family default
, but it's okay if you slip up and forget.
 Since these two keys are bound to the same function in \SpecialChar LyX
, it doesn't really
 matter.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
You do not need to explain everywhere what the 
\family sans
Meta
\family default
 key is or where the 
\family sans
Left
\family default
 key is, et cetera.
 The user isn't stupid.
 Also, someone will document anything that isn't clear (e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

g.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

the 
\family sans
Meta
\family default
 vs.
 
\family sans
Alt
\family default
 problem) someplace in the introduction.
 No need for you to repeat someone else's work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 does not support keyboards missing any of the keys described above, with
 one exception.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 can support a keyboard missing 
\family sans
F11
\family default
 and 
\family sans
F12
\family default
.
 There is a keyboard accelerator for 
\family sans
F10
\family default
, but this is the only function key \SpecialChar LyX
 assumes exists.
 Nevertheless, these details are of minor, if any, concern for the documentation.
 Assume the aforementioned keys exist.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Mice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mouse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and any description of the 3 mouse buttons have no special handling.
 Don't typeset them in any other font than the default, which is Roman.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Exception: you're writing an Author's Note (see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:author-notes"

\end_inset

) and you need to mention something about the mouse.
 Since the rest of the note is in 
\emph on
Emphasized
\emph default
, your description of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

middle mouse button
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 should be emphasized, as well.
 There are a couple of other cases like this one; use your judgement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are only 3 mouse buttons.
 The use of them and of the mouse itself is obvious.
 There are few â€” if any â€” nonstandard things we do with the mouse.
 Therefore, there's no need to make the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mouse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mouse button
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the dim and distant past, whenever someone wanted to document a new feature
 they added, they either wrote a mini-doc and stuck it into the documentation
 directory, or they added a new section to the lone manual.
 No one paid much attention to organization in those days, either.
 The result was a totally bloated, totally unnavigable, and incomplete manual
 orbitted by a swarm of tiny, incomplete mini-docs.
 I don't want the docs to fall back into that mess.

\begin_layout Standard
Don't get hung up on semantics.
 English is a flexible language, and just because your Mothertongue-to-English

 it's so.
 We've had some discussions and misunderstandings on the Developers' List
 because of this very problem.

 one of the American/British/Australian developers can fix it.

Short Sentences.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In English, there is a grammatical error known as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

run-on sentence.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The classic example of a run-on sentence is 7 clauses strung together with
 the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

and.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 There are, however, less obvious run-on sentences, ones using too many
 subordinate clauses.
 Such sentences may look elegant because they are complex.
 However, they are also extremely difficult to read because they are so
 complex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, stick to short sentences in written English.
 Getting rid of passive voice (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
was done by\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) shortens and simplifies them.
 Hacking apart sentences with many dependent clauses is another way to shorten
 sentences.
 There are ways to do this yet still have a smooth-flowing paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While I'm talking about paragraphs, I'll apply the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

shorter is better
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 motto to them, as well.
 At the time I started with the manuals (and this Style Sheet), I didn't
 pay too much attention to paragraph size.
 I've since become a big proponent of short paragraphs, with one idea per
 paragraph.
 While long, flowing, multi-concept paragraphs can be nice in novels, we're
 writing manuals.
 Our goal is rapid information location and comprehension, not a literary
 prize.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a single exception to the short sentence, short paragraph rule.
 Particularly complex ideas may need more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

breathing room.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 However, you shouldn't encounter such complex ideas often when documenting
 \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Try to keep things short, and use your judgement as needed.

Rules of the Translating Trade
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While translating anything, there are certain 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tools of the trade
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 you should use.
 They will help you greatly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Translate one paragraph at a time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most people translate word by word.
 Clearly, you lose all context if you do that.
 A word may have multiple meanings.
 You can't tell which unless you look at the rest of the sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is another level to the context issue, however.
 Your dictionary may translate multiple English words the same way.
 All those words mean 
\emph on
roughly
\emph default
 the same thing.
 Each one, however, covers a different shade of meaning, a different mood
 or intent.
 It is often difficult to resolve those shades of meaning in the context
 of even one sentence.
 A paragraph, however, will provide that context.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
You will not translate it correctly on the first try.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Alright, I admit that you may be able to translate some of the sentences
 at first glance.
 If you know a language well, you may even understand over half of the text.
 Nevertheless, overconfidence can lead you astray.
 There will be some sentences, no matter how few, that will simply confound
 you.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is generally a good idea to make multiple passes over a paragraph you're
 translating.
 Even if you translate the entire paragraph on the first pass, make a second
 one.
 You'll often improve upon your first attempt.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
When in doubt, write down all of the meanings for a word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can often translate tricky parts of a text using the context of the
 surrounding sentences.
 So, if you hit a word or phrase you don't know, translate it more than
 one way.
 Picking the most likely translations, summarize them in one to three words
 in place of an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exact
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 translation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Using context, fix the meanings on the next pass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is where your multiple translations of a single word become useful.
 Using the other sentences you translated, you can now translate that mysteryâ€“se
ntence without reconsulting your dictionary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fix the grammar only after you've finished translating the sentence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If there's a mystery phrase in the middle of a sentence, you can't translate
 the entire sentence.
 Why grammatically rearrange the words you translated already? You may need
 to restructure the sentence a second time once you figure out how to translate
 that mystery phrase.
 Better to wait until you've completely translated the sentence to clean
 up its grammar.
 That way, you do so only once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
If you can't translate it, skip it and come back to it on the next pass.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Remember the earlier discussion of context and its immense usefulness? There
 is no sin in making multiple passes over a tricky passage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Translate the meaning first.
 The rest can wait.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The information content of the text under translation is the most important
 part.
 This is especially important for a manual, where the information 
\emph on
is the only
\emph default
 important part of the original document.
 Lose that, and you lose the very point of performing the translation.

\begin_layout Standard
In English, the passive voice appears formal, dry, barren.
 It also often adds unnecessary complexity.
 In other langauges, however, this is not the case.
 There is nothing wrong with passive voice, and people use it frequently
 in everyday conversation.
 Nevertheless, your translation of the \SpecialChar LyX

\begin_inset Quotes gld

 While sophisticated, the writing style of 
\begin_inset Quotes gld

 If we write in a style only a few people use, and use seldomly, we will

 Use a writing style that mirrors everyday speech (without being vulgar,

 What if, however, short sentences and paragraphs are something only children

The First Is In Charge

\begin_layout Standard
If you were the first person to start translating the manuals, you're the
 \SpecialChar LyX
Doc Translation Project Chief for your language.
 If you are the 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 person translating the \SpecialChar LyX
Docs, that automatically makes you the Translation
 Project Chief.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Amongst other things, that means that you must read this section and perform
 the tasks described here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are a member of a \SpecialChar LyX
 Documentation Translation Team, but 
\emph on

\emph default
 its Chief, you may stop reading.
 The remainder of this section will be of no interest to you.
 If you came to the Style Sheet from the Supplement for your language, you
 may return to it.

\begin_layout Standard
If you have not read the Style Sheet Supplement for your language, you should
 read it now.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Read the Style Sheet
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No documenter is excused from following the Style Sheet, not even a Translation

\begin_layout Standard
No documenter is excused from following the Style Sheet.

\begin_layout Standard
Since your translation team is translating, they know

\begin_layout Standard
There are parts of this Style Sheet that are English-specific.
 I have tried to provide a general, language-independent description of
 certain details in this section.
 Unfortunately, that general description doesn't cover the specifics of
 each language.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's where you, as head of a \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every Translation Team Chief is 
\emph on
required
\emph default
 to write a Supplement to the official Documentation Style Sheet, with specifics
 issues affecting your language.

Font Issues
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second 
\family sans

 will be about font issues\SpecialChar ldots
 if you have any.
 Not all Translation Project Chiefs will need to deal with this issue.
 The fonts:

certainly exist for all languages that use the Roman alphabet.
 Do they exist, however, for Greek? How about Cyrillic? These different
 fonts almost certainly do not exist for Devanagri, Chinese, Korean, Japanese,
 Hebrew, Arabic, and other scripts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There will be some languages for which following the font-scheme specified
 in this Style Sheet may not be possible.
 If you are the Translation Project Chief for such a language, you have
 extra work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the font section of the Supplement, you will provide a new typographic
 style, designed specifically for your writing system.
 For consistency, the title of this section in every Supplement should translate
 into English as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fonts.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Before adding anything to this section, however, determine what this new
 typographic style will look like.
 Stick to the font specifications in this Style Sheet as best you can, whenever
 you can.
 When you cannot, use the following suggestions:

\begin_layout Standard
If you use some special font on-screen to highlight the accelerator keys
 for menus, buttons, and other widgets, you might want to mimic that in
 the translations.
 It is not required, however.
 Therefore, if you can't mimic this typographic convention in your native
 writing system, don't.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Note that you may also want to describe fonts that your Translation Team
 should 
\emph on
never
\emph default
 use.
 For example, no contributer to the English/European versions may ever use
 
\series bold
Boldface
\series default
, as this is used for section-headings.
 Since there are enough other fonts, we who use the Roman alphabet and its
 variants can afford to omit 
\series bold
Boldface
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once you have determined which fonts in your native writing system will
 replace one or more of the above, propose it to the \SpecialChar LyX
 Developer's Mailing
 List.
 You may receive valuable feedback this way.
 If not, that's okay.
 If no one can read your writing system, and therefore cannot comment, that's
 also okay.
 Go ahead and describe the typographic standard you created in the Supplement.

\begin_layout Standard
Remember: stick to the font specifications in this Style Sheet as best you
 can, whenever you can.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Quoting Style and the 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 vs.
 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 Issue
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next section of the Supplement will cover the issue of quoting.
 Give it an appropriate title.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the first things you should do in that section is resolve the following
 issue:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Decide whether 
\family sans
Quote
\family default
 or 
\family sans
Quotation
\family default
 is the correct paragraph environment for your language.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the Supplement, specify which one to use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
English has its own typography and style for quoting others.
 The Style Sheet describes that typography in section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:quote"

\end_inset

.
 Your language also has a specific typography and style for quotations.
 Describe that style in this section of the Supplement, too.
 Naturally, you do not need to go overboard.
 Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:quote"

\end_inset

 of this Style Sheet is overly detailed for a good reason.
 Authors of the primary \SpecialChar LyX
 manuals are not necessarily native English speakers.
 The members of your Translation Team, however, will all likely be native
 speakers of your language.
 Therefore, discuss proper quoting style of your native tongue to an appropriate
 level of detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Translations of Style Sheet Terminology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Supplement, you must provide a standard translation of certain key
 phrases for the members of your Translation Team.
 Place this in a section following the one about quotations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In particular, standardize the translations of the phrases: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Note from 
\noun on
<foo>:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\emph on
Author's Note:

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 however.
 Only provide a translation for the opening phrases.
 Insist that the members of your Translation Team use these two tools correctly.

Personal Note
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 in translations, let's talk about a related problem.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Author's Note
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is meant to be a note from the author of a manual to the reader.
 In the case of a translation, however, the translator is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 the author! How then should a translator translate an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Author's Note?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You, as Translation Project Chief, must decide.
 You can forbid translation of pre-existing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Author's Notes,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 omitting them entirely instead.
 You could tell your translators to read any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Author's Note
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 they may encounter, understand it, then write their own 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Author's Note
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about the situation, not as a translation but as a personal opinion.
 You may decide on some other policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whatever you decide, codify your policy in its own 
\family sans

Throughout the manuals, the DocTeam has used the following sentences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
If you haven't read the <
\emph on
Foo
\emph default
> manual, go read it.
 Yes, we mean now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This sentence will be tricky to translate, since it contains non-translatable
 connotations.
 Therefore, create a 
\family sans
Subsection
\family default
 for this issue in your 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Lost in Translation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 section.
 Present the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
 Yes, we mean now\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sentences, then present a translation, along with any explanation you feel
 necessary.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here's what those two sentences, sitting alone in their own paragraph, mean:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first sentence uses the English conditional followed by an imperative.
 We, as the \SpecialChar LyX
 team, are commanding the reader to go back to another manual.
 For example, the 
\emph on
Intro
\emph default
 manual is a prerequisite for all of the other manuals.
 The conditional clause preceeding the command means, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

You do not need to perform this command twice.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second sentence adds force to the command.
 Culturally, the imperative tense of a verb in English is not necessarily
 forceful.
 The way we wrote that command, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

go read it,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is firm, yet polite.
 The reader may choose to ignore it.
 By following with, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Yes, we mean now,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we imply two things.
 First, we add some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

resistive force
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the command.
 That second sentence reinforces the command, making it a bit harder to
 ignore.
 Second, the sentence itself implies a certain sense of urgency.
 You cannot merely wait until later to fulfill that command.
 The brief pragraph, and its sudden end, add still further subtle reinforcement
 to the command, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

go do the required reading before using this manual.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that all of this commanding and reinforcing is nevertheless in a polite
 format.
 Furthermore, it is in a subtle form.
 We are commanding the reader to do something, but in an indirect fashion.
 This way, the reader does not feel like we are bullying him.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Firm Convincing vs.
 Rudeness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same part of the Supplement that you place the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\SpecialChar ldots
Yes, we mean now\SpecialChar ldots

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 translation, discuss the English version's use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firm convincing.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You see, here in America, we often say that everything is permitted unless
 explicitly banned by law.
 As a result, manuals for computer software are frequently ignored and the
 software subsequently blamed for not being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

user-friendly.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is where the use of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

firm convincing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes in.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We who wrote the manuals added sentences insisting that the reader not ignore
 certain parts of the documentation.
 We wrote in a manner that was polite, yet firmly asserted that the user
 was misusing the software if he did not read the manual correctly.
 We did not, however, want to sound threatening, coercive, or bullying.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In your culture, cajoling the reader into using the manuals correctly may
 not be necessary.
 It may, in fact, be outright rude.
 Additionally, translating the firm-but-convincing bits may not work.
 The translation may sound weird, or rude, or hostile.
 Therefore, you and your translation team will face many sentences that
 you cannot translate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You, the Translation Project Chief, must discuss this issue.
 Try and find parts of the original manuals where some friendly but firm
 convincing does not translate properly.
 Use these cases as the basis for examples of the problem.
 Be sure to then offer a solution (i.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

how you want such sentences translated.) If stumped, ask for help on the
 \SpecialChar LyX
 Developer's List.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Anything Else?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can add more sections to the Supplement if you need to discuss other
 issues.
 There may be policies or guidelines that you want to set for your Translation
 Team.
 Be careful, however! Keep the Supplement
