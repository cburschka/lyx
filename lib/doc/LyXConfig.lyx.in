\layout Standard

This file describes both the different LaTeX add-ons that LyX can handle
 and different external programs that LyX can interact with.
 Below you'll find the following sections:
\layout Enumerate

Some basic details about your LaTeX installation.
 In particular, you should make sure that your version of LaTeX is recent
 enough.
\layout Enumerate

Some common fonts that LyX knows about.
 This is rather sparse at the moment.
\layout Enumerate

The document classes that should be standard on any LaTeX implementation.
 This section is only here for completeness.
\layout Enumerate

Some optional document classes that LyX knows about.
 If one of these is marked as missing (the

 item.
 Note that only detected document classes can be selected as document layouts
 in LyX.
\layout Enumerate

Some packages that LyX use when you try to change the margins of your document.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available
 inside LyX.
\layout Enumerate

Some common LaTeX packages that you might need with LyX, and you might also
 want to add to your LaTeX installation.
 The detection of these items does not yet affect the options available
 inside LyX.
\layout Enumerate

Different required external programs that LyX relies on.
 LyX to a large extent relies on other programs to do it's work, and some
 programs are required for LyX to be useful.
\layout Enumerate

Different optional external programs that LyX can interact with.
 All of these are optional, and some you would want more than others.
\layout Standard

Note that most of these packages will be available if you use a modern TeX
 distribution such as teTeX.
 If you decide to install one of the missing items, you should tell LyX
 about it.
 After the installation, please use the menu entry 
\family sans 
\bar under

or, if you want to change the system-wide settings, issue the command 
\family typewriter 
./configure

 from the LyX system directory (by default 
\family typewriter 
/usr/local/lib/lyx/
\family default 
)
\end_inset 

 and reload this file to see if the new package was recognized.
 If the

 items read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

???
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, it means that LyX could not do the inventory of your LaTeX configuration
 for some reason.
 If you are using teTeX, it might be that the new package you installed
 is not found.
 This is because you forgot to run the command 
\family typewriter 
texhash
\family default 
, which tells teTeX to update its own configuration.
\layout Section

LaTeX version currently in use
\layout Standard

The LaTeX version that LyX will use is: 
\family typewriter 
@chk_fmtversion@
\family default 
.
 Note that, for best results, you should be using at least LaTeX release
 
\family typewriter 
1995/12/01
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

In case it is not clear to you, this number is the date at which the version
 has been released.
\end_inset 

.
 In fact, earlier versions may work for many things, but will certainly
 fail in some cases.
 We feel that it is better to stick to a minimal version than try to work
 around all the quirks of older ones.

Paper layout packages

Required external programs
\layout Standard

LyX is eager to invoke external programs to do some work.
 In line with the Unix tradition, LyX tries to exploit existing programs
 before implementing the same thing itself.
 Over time, LyX is able to interact with an increasing number of both command
 line and interactive applications, and this to a large degree explains
 why LyX is succesful.
\layout Standard

Note: if you use a Linux distribution, such as RedHat or Debian, most of
 these packages should be available as custom packages for the relevant
 system, and you might have most of it installed already.
 And most Unix systems will at least have LaTeX, although it may be a braindead
 version.
 Please check what you have before you go download the lot.
