Introduction
\layout Standard

The 
\emph on 
Extended LyX Features
\emph default 
 manual, which you are now reading, is essentially Part II of the 
\emph on 
User's Guide\SpecialChar \@.

\emph default 
 The reason for splitting this document is simple: the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
 is already huge, and it contains all of the basic features one needs to
 know in order to prepare most documents.
 However, the LyX Team has a long-term goal of making LyX extensible through
 various configuration files and external packages.
 That means that if you want to support the Fizzwizzle LaTeX package, you
 can create a layout file for it without having to alter LyX itself.
 We've already had contributions of several new features this way.
 This is the place where all of that gets documented.
\layout Standard

This manual also documents some special features, like fax support, version
 control, and SGML support, which require additional software to work properly.
 Lastly, there's a chapter of LaTeX tools and tips, things you can use to
 spruce up your documents by directly using the powerful features of LaTeX.
 After all, LyX 
\emph on 
is
\emph default 
 only WYSIWYM, and will only ever interface to certain LaTeX features.
\layout Standard

Of course, with all of this extra documentation, 
\emph on 
Extended LyX Features
\emph default 
 may itself grow too big for its britches.
 In that case, you can just call it the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Overextended Manual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for fun!
\layout Standard

If you haven't read the 
\emph on 
Introduction 
\emph default 
yet, you are definitely in the wrong manual.
 The 
\emph on 
Introduction
\emph default 
 is the first place to go, since it will direct you to the correct manual,
 and it also describes the notation and format of all of the manuals.
 You should also be thoroughly familiar with the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
 and all of the basic features of LyX.
 
\layout Standard

In this document, many sections are independent articles contributed by
 an individual and are noted as such.
 This person is generally whoever wrote the layout file for the new document
 class or LaTeX package, or implemented the feature.
 If there is no mention of an author to a chapter [or chapter sections],
 that means it was written by the LyX Documentation Team.
\layout Standard

Since all the topics in this manual depend heavily on LyX's interaction
 with LaTeX, this first chapter covers
\emph on 
 
\emph default 
the inner workings of LyX and how to direct LyX to generate exactly the
 LaTeX code you want.
 It is obviously for more seasoned LyX users.
\layout Chapter

LyX and LaTeX
\layout Section

How LyX Uses LaTeX
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:lyxandlatex}

\end_inset 

This chapter is for both TeX-nicians and the LaTeX-curious.
 In it, we'll explain how LyX and LaTeX work together to produce printable
 output.
 This is the only place in any of the manuals where we assume you know something
 about LaTeX.
\layout Standard

At one time, we called LyX a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

WYSIWYM frontend to LaTeX,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 but that's no longer true.
 There are frontends to LaTeX out there.
 They are basically editors with the ability to run LaTeX and mark any errors
 in the file you're editing.
 Although LyX 
\emph on 
is
\emph default 
 an editor, and it 
\emph on 
does
\emph default 
 run LaTeX, and it also marks errors in the file, it also does much, much
 more.
 Thanks to the WYSIWYM concept, you don't need LaTeX to use LyX effectively.
 LyX has also added a few extensions to LaTeX.
 Try the following sometime: select 
\family sans 
Export\SpecialChar \menuseparator
LaTeX
\family default 
 from the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile
\family default 
 menu, then look at the preamble of the resulting 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file.
 You'll notice a variety of new macros defined specifically by LyX.
 These macros are defined automatically, according to the features you use
 in the document.
\layout Standard

There are several commands that automatically invoke LaTeX.
 They are:
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
\bar under 
V
\bar default 
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator
View\SpecialChar ~

\emph on 
Format
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
\bar under 
V
\bar default 
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
U
\bar default 
pdate\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\emph on 
Format
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile
\bar under 
\SpecialChar \menuseparator
P
\bar default 
rint
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile
\bar under 
\SpecialChar \menuseparator
F
\bar default 
ax
\layout Standard

They will only invoke LaTeX if the file has changed since the last time
 LaTeX was run.
 
\layout Standard

When you run LaTeX on the file you're editing, LyX performs these steps:
\layout Enumerate

Convert the document to LaTeX and save to a file with the extension 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 in place of 
\family typewriter 
.lyx
\family default 
.
\layout Enumerate

Run LaTeX on the 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file (maybe several times).
\layout Enumerate

If there are any errors, insert error boxes in the document to mark where
 they are.
 These boxes are transient and are not saved along with the document.
\layout Standard

If you've run LaTeX using 
\family sans 
View\SpecialChar ~
DVI
\family default 
, LyX then executes 
\family typewriter 
xdvi
\family default 
 on the Dvi file.
 If you've used 
\family sans 
View\SpecialChar ~
PostScript
\family default 
 or 
\family sans 
\bar under 
P
\bar default 
rint
\family default 
, LyX performs two more steps:
\layout Itemize

Run 
\family typewriter 
dvips
\family default 
 to convert the Dvi file to PostScript®:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Itemize

For 
\family sans 
View\SpecialChar ~
PostScript
\family default 
, the output file has the extension 
\family typewriter 
.ps_tmp
\layout Itemize

For 
\family sans 
\bar under 
P
\bar default 
rint
\family default 
\SpecialChar ~
, the output file has the extension 
\family typewriter 
.ps
\family default 
, as expected.
\end_deeper 
\layout Itemize

Execute 
\family typewriter 
ghostview
\family default 
 or send the PostScript® file to the printer.

Help! LyX generated an unreadable 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Die-hard LaTeX users will scream and howl this into the night, then declare
 LyX useless, simply because they didn't RTFM.
\layout Standard

We're going to set the record straight.
 LyX produces two kinds of LaTeX files.
 One is human readable.
 The other is LyX readable.
 Every time LyX executes LaTeX, it produces a LaTeX file that it can easily
 scan for errors.
 The resulting 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file is not human readable.
 Don't even try to read it.
 If you want a 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file that you can send to a colleague, select 
\family sans 
\bar under 
E
\bar default 
xport\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
L
\bar default 
aTeX
\family default 
 from the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile
\family default 
 menu.
\layout Section

Translating LaTeX files into LyX
\layout Standard

You can import a LaTeX file into LyX by using the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
I
\bar default 
mport\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
L
\bar default 
aTeX
\family default 
 command in LyX.
 This will call a Perl script named 
\family typewriter 
reLyX
\family default 
---which will create a file 
\family typewriter 
foo.lyx
\family default 
 from the file 
\family typewriter 
foo.tex
\family default 
---and then open that file.
 If the translation doesn't work, you can try calling 
\family typewriter 
reLyX
\family default 
 from the command line, possibly using fancier options.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
reLyX
\family default 
 will translate most legal LaTeX, but not everything.
 It will leave things it doesn't understand in TeX mode, so after translating
 a file with 
\family typewriter 
reLyX
\family default 
, you can look for red text and hand-edit it to look right.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
reLyX
\family default 
 has its own section in the 
\emph on 
Extended Features
\emph default 
 manual (as well as a Unix manpage equivalent), which you should read to
 find out about what LaTeX isn't supported, bugs (and how to get around
 them), and how to use the various options.
\layout Standard

If you can't get 
\family typewriter 
reLyX
\family default 
 to work, or you just want to put a piece of LaTeX code into a LyX file,
 see Section
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:latexcodes}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Section

Inserting LaTeX Code into LyX Documents 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Inserting-LaTeX-Code}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:latexcodes}

\end_inset 

 This is a rather important point: You can always insert LaTeX code into
 any LyX document.
 LyX simply cannot, and will probably never be able to, display every possible
 LaTeX construct.
 If ever you need to insert LaTeX commands into your LyX document, you can
 use the ERT box, which you can insert into your document with 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
T
\bar default 
eX
\family default 
.
 The ERT box comes in three forms: collapsed, open, and inlined.
 The first two are used just like any other collapsable (foldable) box (such
 as footnotes), and are useful for significant amounts of LaTeX commands.
 An 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

inlined
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 ERT box displays its content as part of the button, and is useful for very
 short sections of LaTeX commands.
 
\begin_inset ERT
status Inlined

\layout Standard
% like this
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

You can switch between all three by right-clicking on the ERT.
 Note that if you want more than one line of LaTeX commands, you cannot
 use the inlined mode.
\layout Standard

Here's an example of inserting LaTeX commands in a LyX document.
 The code looks like this:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
begin{tabular}{ll}
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\newline 
This is an example for a minipage environment.
 You 
\newline 
can put nearly everything in it, even (non-floating) 
\newline 
figures and tables.
 
\newline 

\backslash 
end{minipage}
\newline 
&
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{verbatim}
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\newline 
This ...
 
\newline 

\backslash 
end{minipage}
\newline 

\backslash 
end{verbatim}
\newline 

\backslash 
end{minipage}
\newline 

\backslash 
end{tabular}
\layout LyX-Code

\layout Standard

The ERT box containing this text is directly after this paragraph.
 Those of you reading the manual online will only see a bunch of funky text
 in red.
 Those reading a printed version of the manuals will see the actual results:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
begin{tabular}{ll}
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\newline 
This is an example for a minipage environment. You can put nearly everything in it, even (non-floating) figures and tables. 
\newline 

\backslash 
end{minipage}
\newline 
&
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{verbatim}
\newline 

\backslash 
begin{minipage}{5cm}
\newline 
This ... 
\newline 

\backslash 
end{minipage}
\newline 

\backslash 
end{verbatim}
\newline 

\backslash 
end{minipage}
\newline 

\backslash 
end{tabular}
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

In addition to these two methods, you can also create a separate file containing
 some complex LaTeX structure.
 You can then use 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Chil
\bar under 
d
\bar default 
\SpecialChar ~
Document
\family default 
 to include your file (you should select the type 
\family sans 
Input
\family default 
).
 We recommend that you only do this if you have a 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file which you 
\emph on 
know
\emph default 
 works already.
 Otherwise, you'll have a big job tracking down LaTeX errors\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\layout Standard

There are a few last notes to emphasize:
\layout Itemize

Inside of LyX, LaTeX code appears 
\emph on 
in red
\layout Itemize

LyX 
\emph on 
does not
\emph default 
 check if your LaTeX code is correct.
\layout Itemize

Beware reinventing the wheel.
\layout Standard

That last note refers to two things.
 First, LyX does have quite a few features tucked into it, and more are
 coming.
 Be sure to check the manuals to make sure that LyX doesn't have such-and-such
 feature before you go off merrily coding LaTeX.
 Second, there are numerous LaTeX packages out there to do all sorts of
 things, from labels to envelopes to fancy multipage tables.
 Check out a CTAN site for details (see Section 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Requirements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 of the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
).

\layout Standard

Note from 
\noun on 
John Weiss
\noun default 
: I seem to do this an awful lot.
 Sat down and merrily began coding something to print out labels, only to
 learn that there were already 2 different LaTeX packages to do this.
 Worse yet --- I had them already!
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

If you do need to do some wild and fancy things within your document, be
 sure to check out a good LaTeX book for assistance.
 There are a number of them listed in the bibliography of the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
.
\layout Standard

There are a number of LaTeX commands which have to be placed before the
 beginning of the actual text.
 They go into the preamble, and this is explained in the next section.
\layout Section

LyX and the LaTeX Preamble
\layout Subsection

About the LaTeX Preamble
\layout Standard


\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:preamble}

\end_inset 

If you already know LaTeX, there is no need to explain here what the preamble
 is good for.
 If you don't, the following will give you some ideas --- we recommend again
 that you consult a LaTeX book for further information.
 In any case, you should read the points below, because they explain what
 you can do and what you don't need to do in the LaTeX preamble of a LyX
 document.
\layout Standard

The LaTeX preamble comes at the very beginning of a document, 
\emph on 
before 
\emph default 
the text.
 It serves to:
\layout Itemize

declare the document class.
 LyX already does this for you.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

If you're a seasoned LaTeX-nician, and you have some custom document class
 you want to use, check out the 
\emph on 
Customization Manual
\emph default 
 for information on how to make LyX interface to it.
 Be sure to submit your efforts to the LyX Team for inclusion in future
 versions!
\end_deeper 
\layout Itemize

declare the usage of packages.
 LaTeX packages provide special commands, which are only available within
 a document when the package has been declared in the preamble.
 For example, the
\family typewriter 
 
\family default 
package 
\family typewriter 
indentfirst
\family default 
 forces all paragraphs to be indented.
 There are other packages for labels, envelopes, margins, etc.
 
\layout Itemize

set counters, variables, lengths and widths.
 There are several LaTeX counters and variables which 
\emph on 
must
\emph default 
 be set globally from within the preamble in order to have the desired effect.
 [There are other variables which you can set and reset inside the document,
 too.] Margins are a good example of something which must be set in the preamble.
 Another example is the label format for lists.
 You can actually set these just about anywhere, but it's best to do it
 just once, inside the preamble.
\layout Itemize

declare user defined commands [with 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
newcommand 
\family default 
or 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
renewcommand
\family default 
], mostly abbreviations for LaTeX commands which appear very often inside
 a document.
 Although the preamble is a good place to declare such commands, they 
\emph on 
can
\emph default 
 be declared anywhere else [but 
\emph on 
before
\emph default 
 they are used for the first time, of course\SpecialChar \ldots{}
].
 This can be useful if there is a lot of raw LaTeX code in your document,
 which normally should not be the case.
\layout Standard

LyX adds its own set of definitions to the preamble of the 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file it produces.
 This makes LaTeX files generated by LyX portable.
\layout Subsection

Changing the Preamble
\layout Standard

The commands which LyX adds to the preamble of a LaTeX file are fixed; you
 can't change them without patching LyX itself.
 You can, however, add your own stuff to the preamble.
 There are two ways to do this:
\layout Enumerate

Select 
\family sans 
\bar under 
L
\bar default 
aTeX\SpecialChar ~

\bar under 
P
\bar default 
reamble
\family default 
 from the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument
\family default 
 menu, or via the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument
\family default 
\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\family sans 
\bar under 
S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
 dialog, depending on your frontend.
 Note that the LyX keybindings will not work in this dialog, alas.
\layout Enumerate

Use the preamble contents you've added as your default template (see 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Basic LyX Setup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
), so that it will be the default preamble for any file you create.
\layout Standard

LyX adds anything in the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
P
\bar default 
reamble
\family default 
 dialog to its own built-in preamble.
 Before adding your own declarations in the preamble, you should make sure
 that LyX doesn't already support what you want to do (remember what we
 said about reinventing the wheel?).
 Also, 
\emph on 
make sure your preamble code is correct
\emph default 
.
 LyX doesn't check it.
\layout Subsection

Examples
\layout Standard

Here are some examples of what you can add to a preamble, and what they
 do:
\layout Subsubsection

Example #1: Offsets
\layout Standard

There are two variables under LaTeX that control page position: 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hoffset
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
voffset
\family default 
.
 Their names should be self-explanatory.
 These variables are useful if you think for a moment about computer labels.
 Sometimes, the size of a print medium and the area of the medium that you
 can actually print on aren't the same.
 This is where 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hoffset
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
voffset
\family default 
 come in.
\layout Standard

The default values for 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hoffset
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
voffset
\family default 
 are both 0 pt.,\SpecialChar ~
i.\SpecialChar ~
e.\SpecialChar ~
the page isn't shifted.
\layout Standard

Unfortunately, some DVI drivers always seem to shift the page.
 We have no idea why, or why the sysadmin hasn't fixed such behavior.
 If you're using LyX on a system that you don't personally maintain, and
 your sysadmin is a doofus, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
hoffset
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
voffset
\family default 
 can save the day.
 Suppose you're left and top margins are always 0.5 inches too big.
 You can add this to the preamble:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
setlength{
\backslash 
hoffset}{-0.5 in}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
setlength{
\backslash 
voffset}{-0.5 in}
\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
and your margins should now be correct.
\layout Subsubsection

Example #2: Labels
\layout Standard

Speaking of labels, suppose you wanted to print out a bunch of address labels.
 There's a rather nice package, available at your nearest CTAN archive,
 for printing sheets of labels, called 
\family typewriter 
labels.sty
\family default 
.
 Now, your system may not have this package installed by default.
 We leave that up to you to check.
 You'll also want to read the documentation for it; we're not going to do
 that for you.
 Since this is an example, however, we'll give you an example of how you
 use this package.
\layout Standard

First, make sure you're using the 
\family sans 
article 
\family default 
document class.
 Next, you need to put the following in your preamble:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
usepackage{labels}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
LabelCols=3
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
LabelRows=7
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
LeftBorder=8mm
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
RightBorder=8mm
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
TopBorder=9mm
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
BottomBorder=2mm
\layout Standard

This sets things up for Avery® label sheets, stock #5360.
 You're now ready to print labels, but you'll need to insert LaTeX code,
 placing the commands 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{labels}
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{labels}
\family default 
 around each label text.
 This and other special features of 
\family typewriter 
labels.sty
\family default 
 are explained in its documentation.
\layout Standard

Someday, someone may write a LyX layout file to support this package directly.
 Maybe that someone is you.
\layout Subsubsection

Example #3: Paragraph Indentation
\layout Standard

Americans are trained to indent the first line of 
\emph on 
every
\emph default 
 paragraph.
 As with all of their other weird quirks, most Americans will whine and
 moan until they can have their way and indent the first line of all paragraphs.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

Note from 
\noun on 
John Weiss
\noun default 
: This was written by an American --- 
\emph on 
me
\emph default 
! It's my perception of my fellow countrymen.
 Tough if you don't like it.
 Thpbpbpbpbpbpbpbp!
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

Of course, this behavior isn't standard typography.
 In books, you typically only indent the first line of a paragraph 
\emph on 
if
\emph default 
 it follows another one.
 The idea behind indenting the first line of a paragraph is to distinguish
 neighboring paragraphs from one another.
 If there is no previous paragraph, for example, it follows a figure, or
 is the first paragraph in a section, then there is no special indentation.
 
\layout Standard

If you're a typical American, though, you don't care about such esoteric
 things; you want your indentation! Add this to the preamble:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
usepackage{indentfirst}
\layout Standard

If your TeX distribution isn't a braindead one, you'll have this package,
 and all of your paragraphs will get the indentation you think they deserve.
\layout Subsubsection

Example #4: This Document
\layout Standard

You can also check out the preamble of this document to get an idea of some
 of the advanced things you can do.
 You'll probably need to make the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
P
\bar default 
reamble\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\family default 
 dialog full-screen to see most of it.
 Also, there are more examples and an assortment of LaTeX

\layout Section

LyX and LaTeX Errors
\layout Standard

When LyX calls LaTeX, it tells LaTeX to blithely ignore any errors and keep
 going.
 It then uses the log-file from the LaTeX run to do a post-mortem.
 As we stated earlier in the chapter, LyX generates two kinds of 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 files, one of which it uses to locate errors in the document.
 If there was an error someplace, LyX will put a box with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Error

\end_deeper 
\layout Standard

There are other error and warning messages.
 Some are self-explanatory.
 These are usually LaTeX messages.
 Others are downright cryptic.
 These are actually TeX error messages, and we really have 
\emph on 
no clue
\emph default 
 what they mean or how to decipher them.
\layout Standard

There's a general sequence you should follow if you get error messages:
\layout Enumerate

Look at the LaTeX code you inserted for typos.
\layout Enumerate

If there are no typos, check and see that you used the command(s) correctly.
\layout Enumerate

If you get a bunch of error boxes piled up at the very top of the document,
 it means that there are errors in the preamble.
 Start debugging your preamble.
\layout Enumerate

If you didn't add anything to the preamble and didn't add any LaTeX code
 to the document, the first suspect is your LaTeX distribution itself.
 Check for missing packages and install them.
\layout Enumerate

Okay, so there are no missing packages.
 Did you use any of the fine-tuning options in LyX? Specifically, did you
 
\emph on 
misuse
\emph default 
 any of them, like trying to manually insert lots of 
\family sans 
Protected\SpecialChar ~
Blank
\family default 
s, 
\family sans 
Linebreak
\family default 
s, or 
\family sans 
Pagebreak
\family default 
s? Did you try to kludge something together with these instead of using
 the appropriate paragraph environment?
\layout Enumerate

All right, you didn't use any of the fine-tuning options, you played by
 the rules.
 Did you try to pull a fancy maneuver? Did you do something funky inside
 a table or an equation, like inserting a graphic into a table cell?
\layout Enumerate

Do you have long sections of text where LaTeX cannot find a place to break
 a line? By default, LaTeX is rather strict about how much extra inter-word
 spacing it will add in order to break a line.
 Preferrably, you should rework the paragraph to avoid the problem.
 If this isn't an option, you can wrap your text in 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
sloppypar
\family default 
 to make LaTeX's line breaking more, well, sloppy.
\layout Enumerate

Did you go overboard with the nesting? LyX (currently) doesn't check to
 make sure you're in the limits for nesting environments.
 If you nested a bunch of environments to the 
\begin_inset Formula $17^{\mathrm{th}}$
\end_inset 

 level, that's the problem.
\layout Enumerate

Okay, you didn't get any error messages, but your output looks whacked.
 If you have a table or figure that's too wide or long for the page, you
 need to:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

rescale the figure so it fits.
\layout Enumerate

trim down the table so it fits.
\layout Standard

If something else is wrong with the output, and you didn't try to pull anything
 fancy or kludge the fine-tuning options, we're not sure what's wrong.
\end_deeper

If all this doesn't help --- well, then

 you might have found a bug in LyX\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\layout Standard
\noindent 
STOP! If you don't know what BibTeX is, or have a reasonably good idea of
 how to use it (
\emph on 
e.g.

\emph default 
 setting up your own bibliographic databases), 
\emph on

\emph default 
, do not walk, to your nearest copy of the 2nd edition of Lamport's 
\emph on 
LaTeX: A Document Preparation System
\emph default 
, particularly Appendix B.
 The rest of this discussion assumes you have created a correct bibliography
 file, that you have all relevant environment variables set correctly (esp.
 
\family typewriter 
BIBINPUTS
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
BSTINPUTS
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter

\family default 
), and that if sufficiently desperate, you could create and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

TeX
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 a LaTeX file with a BibTeX database.
 
\layout Standard

For those who don't know what BibTeX is, it is a system for creating a large
 database of your most used journal references.
 For all future articles you write, you only need to include this standard
 database and reference the appropriate key to each reference.
 Even if you write only a few papers with handful of references each, it
 is well worth your time to examine BibTeX and decide whether it will be
 useful to you.
\layout Standard

To use BibTeX with LyX, first read the 
\emph on 
User Guide
\emph default 
 where it describes how to insert citations.
 The basic mechanism for inserting BibTeX references is the same.
 Then, at the very end of your document, select 
\family sans 
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
List
\family default 
 / 
\family sans 
TOC\SpecialChar \menuseparator
BibTeX Reference
\family default 
.
 In the resulting dialog, fill out the dialog boxes as follows: 
\layout Description

Database: enter the name of your 
\family typewriter 
.bib
\family default 
 file 
\emph on 
without
\emph default 
 the 
\family typewriter 
.bib
\family default 
 extension.
 For searching multiple 
\family typewriter 
.bib
\family default 
 files, just enter them in the desired order, separated by commas.
 
\layout Description

Style: enter the name of your BibTeX style file *without* the 
\family typewriter 
.bst
\family default 
 extension.
 The default style is 
\family typewriter 
plain
\family default 
 (which should be included in your LaTeX distribution, so you don't have
 to worry about creating it).
\layout Standard

For each citation, assuming that the source is in the 
\family typewriter 
.bib
\family default 
 file, just call 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
C
\bar default

\family default 
 at the correct location in the text, and enter the appropriate reference

\family sans 
\bar under

\bar default 
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

\family default 
, for example, you should see that BibTex and LaTeX are invoked as needed,
 including multiple invocations of LaTeX.
 
\layout Section

Making an Index
\layout Standard

A good index is one of the hardest things to make in a lengthy document,
 but LyX helps make things a bit simpler by interfacing to the 
\family typewriter 
makeindex
\family default 
 program which is found in most recent LaTeX distributions.
 Inserting an index and marking words to include in it works much the same
 way as preparing a bibliography as mentioned in the last section.
\layout Standard

First, go to the end of your file and select 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
List
\family default 
\SpecialChar ~
/\SpecialChar ~

\family sans 
T
\bar under

\bar default 
C\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
I
\bar default 
ndex
\family default 
\SpecialChar ~

\family sans 
List
\family default 
.
 Then, for each word you would like to include in the index, go to the end
 of that word and click on 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
I
\bar default 
ndex
\family default 
\SpecialChar ~

\family sans 
Entry
\family default 
.
 This will insert a tag showing the word as it will appear in the index.
 That's all there is to it; LyX will automatically call 
\family typewriter 
makeindex
\family default 
 for you and create the index itself.
 The text in the dialog available from right-clicking on the index button
 accepts LaTeX, so you'll need to be careful to avoid using any special
 characters.
 On the positive side, you can use the advanced options - have a look at
 the documentation which comes with your LaTeX distribution to find out
 how to do things like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

nested entries
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, etc.
\layout Standard

Be careful not to put spaces between the word in the text and the index
 marker; apparently the wrong page number can be produced if this happens.
\layout Section

Multipart Documents
\layout Subsection

General Operation
\layout Standard

When you are working on a large file with many sections, it is often convenient
 to break up the document into several files, or perhaps you have something
 where a table may change from time to time, but the preceding text does
 not.
 In these cases, you should seriously consider using multipart documents.
 For example, scientific papers often have five major sections: the introduction
, observations, results, discussion, and conclusion.
 Each of these could be its own separate LyX file, with one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

master
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 file which contains the title, authors, abstract, references, etc., plus
 the five included files.
 It is important to note that each of these files is a full LyX file which
 can be formatted and printed on its own, as well as included in a master
 file.
 Each of these files must have the same document class, however--- don't
 attempt to mix book classes with article classes.
 You may also include LaTeX files; however, these files must not have their
 own preamble 
\emph on 
(i.e.

\emph default 
 everything up to and including the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{document}
\family default 
 line as well as the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{document}
\family default 
 line must be deleted) or else errors will be generated when you try to
 make a DVI file.
\layout Standard

LyX allows you to include files quite easily with 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
ChiI
\bar under 
d
\bar default 
\SpecialChar ~
Document
\family default 
.
 When you click on this selection a small box is inserted into the file
 at the current cursor location.
 Clicking on the box raises a dialog which allows you to select the file
 to be included, and the method of its inclusion.
 
\layout Standard

The file selection box should by now be obvious.
 The three inclusion methods are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

include
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

input
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

verbatim
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The difference between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

include
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

input
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is really only meaningful to LaTeXperts, but the practical difference is
 that files which are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

included
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 are typeset beginning on a new page, while files which are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

inputted
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 are typeset starting on the current page.
 Perhaps the labeling in LyX will be changed someday to reflect this.
\layout Standard

Generally, the master file is converted into a full LaTeX file before typesettin
g, while the included files are converted to LaTeX files which do not have
 all the preamble information.
 Checking the 
\family sans 
Don't
\family default 
\SpecialChar ~

\family sans 
typeset
\family default 
 button prevents this conversion.
\layout Standard

A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

verbatim
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 included file allows you to include a file typeset exactly as it appears
 in the file, i.e.\SpecialChar ~
verbatim mode, with the characters set in a fixed-width
 typewriter font.
 Normally, spaces in this file are invisible, though two consecutive spaces
 are conserved, unlike LyX's normal treatment of spaces.
 However, setting the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
M
\bar default 
ark\SpecialChar ~
spaces\SpecialChar ~
in\SpecialChar ~
output
\family default 
 checkbox typesets a mark to unambiguously define the presence of a space.

Cross-References Between Files
\layout Standard

It is possible to set up cross-references between the different files.
 First, open all the files in question: let's call them A and B in a two
 file example, where B is included in A.
 Let's say you insert a label in A, then want to reference it in B.
 Open the cross-reference dialog in whilst in document B, and you can select
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

buffer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to use.
\layout Section

Algorithms
\layout Standard

The package 
\family sans 
algorithm
\family default 
 is needed by LyX to be able to output algorithm floats.
 These are useful in placing short algorithms across page breaks and support
 an index of algorithms too.
\layout Section

Subfigures
\layout Standard

The package
\family sans 
 subfigure 
\family default 
is used by LyX when you select ``subfigure'' in the graphics dialog and
 enter the subfigure caption.
 Several figures marked in this way can be packed into a single float with
 individual sub-captions.
\layout Section

Fancy Headers and Footers
\layout Standard

The default page layout is rather plain; for an article document class,
 all you get is a centered page number at the bottom of the page.
 This document is the book class, so it appears to be a bit fancier, but
 to really put on a show, you need to set the document page style to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

fancy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, as mentioned in the 
\family sans 
User\SpecialChar ~
Guide
\family default 
.
 This section describes the LaTeX codes you need to insert in your LaTeX
 preamble or the text in order to get the desired effects.
\layout Standard

The page header is divided into three fields, not surprisingly labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

left
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

center
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The footer is also divided into these three fields.
 The LaTeX commands to set these fields in the simplest manner are 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
lhead
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
chead
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
rhead
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
lfoot
\family default 
, etc.
 Suppose you wish to put your name in the upper left hand corner of each
 page.
 Simply insert the following command in the preamble: 
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
lhead{John Q.
 DocWriter}
\layout Standard

You will now see your name in the upper left.
 If a field has a default entry that you would like to get rid of (often
 the page number appears in the central footer, simply include a command
 with a blank argument, e.g.
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
cfoot{}
\layout Standard

Let's get really fancy: lets put the section number with the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Section
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (e.g.
 Section 3) in the upper left, the page number (e.g.
 Page 4) in the upper right, your name in the lower left, and the date in
 the lower right.
 The following commands should now appear in the preamble:
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
lhead{Section 
\backslash 
thesection}
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
chead{}
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
rhead{Page 
\backslash 
thepage}
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
lfoot{John Q.
 DocWriter}
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
cfoot{}
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
rfoot{
\backslash 
today}
\layout Standard

The codes 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thesection
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thepage
\family default 
 access LaTeX's section and page counters, and so print out the current
 section and page numbers.
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
today
\family default 
 simply prints out today's date.
\layout Standard

The thicknesses of the horizontal rules drawn beneath the header and above
 the footer can also be modified.
 If you don't want one of the headers, set its thickness to 0.
 The header rule has a default thickness of 0.4pt, the footer rule is 0pt.
 Use the commands, e.g.
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
headrulewidth}{0.4pt}
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
footrulewidth}{0.4pt}
\family default 
 to set the thicknesses.
\layout Standard

You can switch the header/footer settings on and off for individual pages
 using commands like 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thispagestyle{empty}
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thispagestyle{plain}
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thispagestyle{fancy}
\family default 
.
 Simply insert them in the text on the page you want changed and mark them
 as TeX code.
 In fact, title pages are marked as plain by default, while following pages
 are marked fancy when using the global fancy setting.
\layout Standard

There are more complex commands which will let you insert things in the
 upper left on odd numbered pages, etc., but I will refer you to the 
\family typewriter 
fancyhdr
\family default 
 package documentation for more descriptions.
 For example, if you have a teTeX installation, look for 
\family typewriter 
/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/fancyhdr/\SpecialChar \-
fancyhdr.dvi
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

As a final example, it is possible to include an Encapsulated PostScript®
 file in the header or footer.
 Suppose you want to put a company logo in the upper lefthand corner.
 You might try something like
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
lhead{
\backslash 
resizebox{1in}{!}{
\backslash 
includegraphics{logo.eps}}}
\layout Standard
\noindent 
(you may need to preface this with 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
usepackage{graphics}
\family default 
 if you don't include EPS files elsewhere in your document).
\layout Section

Minipages
\layout Standard

LaTeX provides a mechanism to produce essentially a page within a page,
 called minipages.
 Within a minipage, all the usual rules of indentation, line wrapping, etc.\SpecialChar ~
apply.
 LyX also provides some of the minipage capability.
\layout Standard

Minipages in LyX have their own collapsable box; insert one via 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Mini
\bar under 
p
\bar default 
age
\family default 
.
 Right-clicking on the box allows you to alter the minipage's width and
 alignment within the page.
 Warning: if the minipage is too long to fit on a page, it is truncated,
 not wrapped onto the next page.
\layout Standard

If you place two minipages side-by-side, you can use 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
S
\bar default 
pecial\SpecialChar ~
Character
\family default 
 to insert a special instruction known in the LaTeX world as an 
\family typewriter 
hfill
\family default 
 to put a maximum amount of space between them; it forces one minipage to
 the left edge, the other to the right edge.
 The examples below show the difference.
\layout Standard


\begin_inset Minipage

Wrapping Text Around Figures

This is a wrapped figure, and this is the brilliant caption that describes
 it
\end_inset

A very frequently asked question is whether text can be made to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

wrap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 around figures so that a figure occupies some fraction of the column width
 and text fills the rest.
 If you have the LaTeX package 
\family typewriter 
floatflt
\family default 
 installed (you can find out about it in the 
\emph on 
LaTeX Configuration
\emph default 
 manual) you can do this.
\layout Standard

At the right is a figure of a mobius strip---you should have already seen
 this in the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
.
 To wrap the text like this insert a wrap box via 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Flo
\bar under 
a
\bar default 
ts\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Floatflt Figure
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

Note: this package is very fragile! For example, having a figure too close
 to the bottom of the page will mess things up, as will having two figures
 close together.
 Use this package sparingly and do read the documentation that came with
 it (which will also tell you how to wrap text around tables).
\layout Section

Extra Table Options
\layout Standard

While the standard table layout will suffice in 99% of all tables you generate,
 occasionally you will run into one which requires a bit of extra tweaking.
 The table dialog which appears on a right-click of a table allows these
 tweaks to be made.
 It will give you access to some extra column alignment parameters.
 A little bit of LaTeX background is useful here: when you set up a table
 in LaTeX, each column is given an alignment type.
 For example, you would give it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
l
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
c
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
r
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 for left-aligned, centered, and right-aligned columns respectively (which
 appear as the left/center/right radio buttons in LyX).
 A fourth type is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
p
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, which will make a column of a specified width (the width box in LyX),
 and will wrap text within that box.
 A fifth type is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
|
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (vertical bar) which rather than making a column will make a vertical rule
 at that point; this manifests itself in LyX as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

borders
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 buttons.
 Finally, there is a type 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
@
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, which allows you to use whatever is enclosed in the accompanying braces
 as the column separator, including a null argument.
 The reasons for doing this may not be obvious, but they can be very powerful.
 They are best demonstrated by example.

Making a Decimal Point Aligned Column
\layout Standard

Okay, that last example was very silly, but here is one that is not.
 Suppose you want to make a table that has a column which is aligned on
 a decimal point.
 A standard LaTeX trick to do this is to set the whole number part in a
 right-aligned column, use a decimal point for the column separator, then
 set the fractional part as a left-aligned column.
 A variation on this is to include the decimal point explicitly with the
 whole part, then use just a null separator in between.
 The latter variation is demonstrated here:

Though it appears a bit funny in LyX, on paper it will produce what appears
 to be a 2-column table in which the right column is aligned on the decimal

Perhaps it is best if I described just what I did: first, create a 3

3 table and remove all the borders.
 Then re-add a bottom border to the top row, and a right border to the first
 column.
 Type in the values for the first column and set its alignment to

\family default

 Type in the

 Type in the

A Better Decimal-Alignment Solution
\layout Standard

An alternative way to have decimal alignment in tables is through the 
\family typewriter 
dcolumn
\family default 
 package.
 Add the following to the LateX preamble:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
usepackage{dcolumn}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}}
\layout Standard

To have a column decimally aligned, enter in the 
\family sans 
Special Column Alignment
\family default 
 box of the 
\family sans 
Table
\family default 
 dialog the following:
\layout LyX-Code

d{number of decimals of the data}
\layout Standard

To create extra column space just increase the number of decimals in 
\family typewriter 
d{}
\family default 
.
 Setting the multicolumn attribute for a single cell makes it insensitive
 to the decimal alignment which comes in handy as well.
 A drawback of this method is that math mode is not allowed in a column
 with decimal alignment except if the multicolumn attribute is set.
\layout Standard

This method offers the same flexibility as the 
\family typewriter 
dcolumn
\family default 
 package.
 One could, for example, change the alignment separator, and have different
 alignment separators for different columns by defining multiple column
 types in the preamble.
 The syntax is as follows: 
\layout LyX-Code

D{inputsep}{outputsep}{decimal places}
\layout Standard

The interested reader is directed towards the 
\family typewriter 
dcolumn
\family default 
 package documentation for more details.

Introduction
\layout Standard

LyX provides 216 bullet shapes that can be accessed from a simple dialog.
 Using this dialog you can easily specify what bullet shape to use at each
 level of an itemized list.
 These settings are document-wide so you won't be able to specify different
 sets of bullets for different paragraphs
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

Well, actually you can but you'll have to do it by hand.
\end_inset

How it looks
\layout Standard

Open the dialog by selecting the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
 menu item and then select the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
B
\bar default 
ullets
\family default 
 tab.
\layout Standard

The dialog provides you with a table of bullet shapes.
 A column of buttons on the left of the table provides access to the six
 different panels of bullet shapes.
 The row of buttons across the top is used to select which bullet depth
 you are changing.
 A text entry under the table shows the currently selected bullet shape's
 LaTeX equivalent and this can be edited if desired.
 If you do modify the text you will also need to specify any needed packages
 in the LaTeX preamble.
\layout Standard

The six panels are divided up by the packages they require.
 The following table shows the mappings from button name to LaTeX packages.

LyX doesn't stop you using bullets from packages you don't have.
 If you get errors from LaTeX when you try to view or print the file then
 its likely you are missing a package.
 LyX doesn't restrict your use since you may be editing locally and exporting
 elsewhere.
\layout Subsection

How to use it
\layout Standard

Select which bullet depth you want to change then select the bullet shape
 and size.

\family sans 
 
\family default 
Any changes will not be visible in LyX, but are visible when viewing the
 document using xdvi or ghostview.
\layout Standard

You can reset a bullet shape to the default simply by clicking your right
 mouse button on the appropriate bullet depth button.
\layout Standard

If you 
\emph on 
really
\emph default 
 want to have multiple sets of paragraphs with different sets of bullets
 in each then you're going to have to get your hands dirty.
 The itemize bullet selection dialog can help though because it provides
 you with the LaTeX code for a wide range of bullet shapes.
 To make your own custom paragraphs you have the following options:
\layout Standard


\begin_inset ERT
status Inlined

\layout Standard

\backslash 
let
\backslash 
savelabelitemi=
\backslash 
labelitemi
\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\begin_inset ERT
status Inlined

\layout Standard

\backslash 
renewcommand
\backslash 
labelitemi[0]{
\backslash 
small
\backslash 
(
\backslash 
sharp
\backslash 
)}
\end_inset 


\layout Itemize

Use the LaTeX command 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
renewcommand{}{}
\family default 
 to specify a new bullet shape for a given depth.
 You'll also need to save the current bullet shape so you can restore it
 again afterwards.
 In this itemized list the following LaTeX code was used to change the bullet
 used for the first depth.
\newline 

\family typewriter 

\backslash 
let
\backslash 
savelabelitemi=
\backslash 
labelitemi
\family default

\newline 

\backslash 
renewcommand
\backslash 
labelitemi[0]{
\backslash 
small
\backslash 
(
\backslash 
sharp
\backslash 
)}
\newline 

\family default 
Note that the itemize depth is specified in Roman numerals as part of the
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
labelitem
\family default 
 command.
\layout Itemize


\begin_inset ERT
status Inlined

\layout Standard
[
\backslash 
(
\backslash 
star
\backslash 
)]
\end_inset 

 Specify each individual entry by starting each item with the bullet shape
 enclosed in square brackets and set as TeX.
 For example, this item was started with 
\family typewriter 
[
\backslash 
(
\backslash 
star
\backslash

\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

\backslash 
renewcommand
\backslash 
labelitemi[0]{
\backslash

You'll also need to revert the labelitem back to its previous setting for
 the global bullet shape settings to remain in effect.

AMS LaTeX
\layout Standard

by 
\noun on 
David Johnson
\layout Standard
\added_space_top bigskip \noindent 
The AMS LaTeX layouts are set up to conform to suggested styles for mathematical
 papers to be submitted to American Mathematical Society publications.
 The layouts are not tailored to a specific journal, but easily can be.
 You should refer to the AMS documentation for specific instructions for
 each journal (usually it will entail only changing a single line in the
 TeX output).
 That documentation is available on the Web at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.ams.org}

\end_inset 

 or by ftp at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/amslatex/}

\end_inset 

.These layouts are appropriate, and useful, for any mathematical writing.
 There are currently 4 distinct AMS LaTeX layouts: 
\layout Enumerate

amsart: The standard AMS-article format.
 All results and similar statements are numbered as 
\begin_inset Formula $(n.m)$
\end_inset 

, where the first number refers to the section, and the second refers to
 the total number of results (Theorems, Corollaries, Propositions, Definitions
 and Remarks, etc.) in that section.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
 Unnumbered environments indicated by an asterisk at the end.
\layout Enumerate

amsart-seq: Here, numbering for each type of statement is in its own sequence,
 with no reference to the section number.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
 Unnumbered environments indicated by an asterisk at the end.
\layout Enumerate

amsart-plain: This one is even more terse, since all the environments are
 unnumbered.
\layout Enumerate

amsbook: the standard AMS book (really, monograph) format.
 Numbering is similar to the amsart layout, except that all numbering is
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $(n.m.p)$
\end_inset 

, where the first number refers to the chapter, the second to the section,
 and the third is the number of the results (Theorems, Corollaries, Propositions
, Definitions and Remarks, etc.) in that section.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
 Unnumbered environments indicated by an asterisk at the end.
\layout Standard

Any AMS LyX file can be converted to either of the numbering schemes by
 simply changing the document class in the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
 dialog.
 
\layout Subsection

What these layouts provide
\layout Standard

There is a long list of included environments provided by these layouts.
 Most mathematical papers or books will set as special statements most of
 these environments, in AMS-LaTeX there is an opportunity to define an unlimited
 variety of such declarations.
 However, the AMS recommends the environments that are available in LyX.
 The list of environments (not counting the standard environments such as
 
\family sans 
sections, bibliography, title, author, date
\family default 
), is:
\layout Description

Theorem This is typically used for the statements of major results.
 The word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
Theorem
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 appears in bold type, along with an automatically-determined number (an
 unnumbered version, 
\family sans 
Theorem*
\family default 
, is also available).
 The text is italicized.
\layout Description

Corollary This is used for statements which follow fairly directly from
 previous statements.
 Again, these can be major results.
 Unnumbered version 
\family sans 
Corollary*
\family default 
 is available.
\layout Description

Lemma These are smaller results needed to prove other statements.
\layout Description

Proposition These are less major results which (hopefully) add to the general
 theory being discussed.
\layout Description

Conjecture These are statements provided without justification, which the
 author does not know how to prove, but which seem to be true (to the author,
 at least).
\layout Description

Criterion A required condition.
\layout Description

Algorithm A general procedure to be used.
\layout Description

Axiom This is a property or statement taken as true within the system being
 discussed.
\layout Description

Definition Guess what this is for.
 The font, both on-screen and in the output, is different for this environment
 than for the previous ones.
 The heading (
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

definition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) is still set in boldface, along with the number, if any, but the rest
 is set upright.
\layout Description

Example Typeset similarly to Definition.
\layout Description

Condition
\layout Description

Problem
\layout Description

Exercise
\layout Description

Remark This environment is also a new type of theorem.
 This is set with the word Remark in italics, and the rest upright.
\layout Description

Note Set similarly to the Remark environment.
\layout Description

Notation
\layout Description

Claim
\layout Description

Summary
\layout Description

Case Generally, these are used to break up long arguments, using specific
 instances of some condition.
 The numbering scheme for cases is on its own, not together with other numbered
 statements.

 At the end of this environment (other environments can be nested within
 this one, of course) a QED symbol (usually a square, but it can vary with
 different styles) is placed.
\layout Description

\layout Standard

A manual comes together with that package, and this text is not meant to
 replace the original manual but merely a short guide how to realize the
 correct form of your paper.
 
\layout Standard

Please note that the publisher of the journal was changed from Springer
 to EDP Sciences starting January 1, 2001.
 That change implicated also some slight changes of the style files, namely
 the removal of the thesaurus command.
 The LyX class aa supports the newest version of these style files, V 5.01.
 If you have an older version installed, please upgrade.
 For compatibility, the old (version 4) layout has been kept as 
\family sans

\family default 
.
 Please refer to the comments in 
\family typewriter 
LyXDir/layouts/aapaper.layout
\family default 
.
\layout Subsection

Getting started
\layout Standard

It is recommended you start from the example template distributed with LyX.
 If you are not using a template, note the following settings:
\layout Itemize

Select 
\family sans 
article (A&A)
\family default 
 in the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
 dialog (OK, that one was obvious).
\layout Itemize

Don't change the option 
\family sans 
Page\SpecialChar ~
style
\family default 
: Leave it set to 
\family sans 
default
\family default 
.
 The whole layout is done by the macros, you shouldn't change anything.
\layout Subsection

The header block
\layout Standard

First thing to enter is the header information.
 It consists of seven entries, of which some are optional.
 They are
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Title
\family default 
: [required] 
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Subtitle
\family default 
: [optional] 
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Author
\family default 
: [required]
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Address
\family default 
: [required]
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Offprints
\family default 
: [optional] if more than one author: whom to contact for offprint requests.
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Mail
\family default 
: [optional] mail address for contacts.
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Date
\family default 
: [required].
 Suggested format is 
\family typewriter 
Received: <date>; Accepted <date> 
\layout Standard

There is no need to issue the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
maketitle
\family default 
 command, this is done automatically by LyX when the header is finished.
 Although the order of the single header entries doesn't matter it is advised
 to keep the above sequence, just to get the best optics and meets the layout
 of the real document.
\layout Standard

If you want to place footnotes in the header block, e.g.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
 
\end_inset 

to state your present address, just use the standard footnote via 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ootnote.
 
\family default 
LyX will automagically use the term 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thanks{}
\family default 
 in that case.
\layout Standard

In addition to these topics, the macros use three additional LaTeX commands
 that have no counterpart in LyX:
\layout Itemize


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
and
\family default 
 to separate different names for more than one author and institute, respectivel
y.
\layout Itemize


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
inst{<nr>}
\family default 
to mark corresponding author/institute pairs.
 The institutes are numbered sequentially as they appear in the 
\family sans 
Address
\family default 
 field, so you have to put a marker to each author.
\layout Itemize


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
email{address}
\family default 
 to supply an email address for fast contact.
\layout Standard

In all cases, the appropriate command has to be entered in LyX an marked
 as LaTeX code.
 See the examples.
 
\layout Subsection

The abstract
\layout Standard

The abstract should immediately follow the header block.
 With version 5 the abstract environment was changed to a command, and there
 is now a resctriction to only one paragraph.
 In addition, it should contain an entry with the keywords.
 This is not yet implemented for LyX, therefore you have to enter the LaTeX
 command 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
keywords{}
\family default 
 by hand and mark it as LaTeX code.
 Refer to the example paper.
\layout Subsection

Figure and Table Floats
\layout Standard

LyX provides support for the necessary float environments 
\family sans 
figure, figure*, table 
\family default 
and 
\family sans 
table*
\family default 
, therefore we won't tell much about it here.
 Refer to the 
\emph on

\layout Standard

Also, refer to the figures in the example paper.
\layout Subsection

Referee layout
\layout Standard

For submission, the paper has to be formated in a special double-spacing
 layout.
 For this purpose, you have to give the option 
\family typewriter

\family default 
 to the documentclass.
 This must be done using the extra class options field in the 
\family sans 
\bar under

AASTeX
\layout Standard

by 
\noun on 
Mike Ressler
\layout Subsection

Introduction
\layout Standard

AASTeX is a set of macros produced by the American Astronomical Society
 to facilitate electronic manuscript submission to the three journals they
 publish: the Astrophysical Journal (including the Letters and Supplement),
 the Astronomical Journal, and the Publications of the Astronomical Society
 of the Pacific.
 LyX requires version 5.0 (or higher) of these macros.
 Versions prior to 5.0 are intended for use with LaTeX2.09 and are fundamentally
 incompatible with LyX.
 The AASTeX package may be downloaded from the AAS's ftp site
\layout Standard
\added_space_top medskip \added_space_bottom medskip \align center 

\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{ftp://ftp.aas.org/pubs}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A complete user guide is contained in that package and you should familiarize
 yourself with it thoroughly before embarking on writing a paper in LyX.
 LyX will not reduce the need to figure out all the AASTeX commands, it
 will only reduce the drudgery of typing everything in.
 It is your responsibility to ensure that the final exported LaTeX document
 conforms completely to the requirements of the journal to which you are
 submitting your paper.
\layout Subsection

Starting a New Paper
\layout Standard

I strongly suggest that you start with the AASTeX template file.
 Click on 
\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New from 
\bar under 
T
\bar default 
emplate
\family default 
, enter the new file name, then choose the 
\family typewriter 
aastex.lyx
\family default 
 template.
 This will show the most common fields found in a manuscript.
 Simply overwrite the existing text (including the brackets, 
\family typewriter 
<>
\family default 
) with the correct information.
 Many of the AASTeX commands and environments can be implemented directly
 in LyX, but some cannot: most noticeably 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
altaffilmark
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
altaffiltext
\family default 
, which should stick out like a sore thumb if you actually just opened the
 template file.
 For commands such as these, the LaTeX code must be entered directly and
 marked as such.
 Such commands are referred to as ERT, or Evil Red Text.
 I tried to minimize the amount of ERT needed in an AASTeX document, but
 there is still more required than any of us would like.

FAQs, Tips, Tricks, and Other Ruminations
\layout Subsubsection

Getting LyX and AASTeX to cooperate
\layout Standard

It can be a bit tricky to get LyX to recognize a new layout and document
 class.
 When all else fails, do this:
\layout Enumerate

Make certain that LaTeX can find AASTeX.
 Copy sample.tex (and perhaps table.tex) from the AASTeX distribution into
 a directory completely unrelated to LaTeX or AASTeX and run LaTeX on 
\family typewriter 
sample.tex
\family default 
.
\layout Enumerate

Make certain that 
\family typewriter 
aastex.layout
\family default 
 appears in 
\family typewriter 
/usr/.../share/lyx/layouts
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 
~/.lyx/layouts
\family default 
.
\layout Enumerate

Rerun 
\family sans 
\bar under 
T
\bar default 
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
R
\bar default 
econfigure
\family default 
 in LyX, then restart LyX.
\layout Enumerate

Open a regular new file, not from a template.
 Does AASTeX appear in the class list in 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
?
\layout Standard

If you get a warning from an existing AASTeX document about not being able
 to find the AASTeX layout or a message about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

You should not mix title layouts with normal ones
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, things haven't been installed correctly.
\layout Subsubsection

LaTeX error processing a table 
\layout Standard

LyX, by default, attempts to center the table caption/title.
 This seems to produce a bad interaction in AASTeX so you should click somewhere
 in the caption/title, then select 
\family sans 
\bar under 
E
\bar default 
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
P
\bar default 
aragraph\SpecialChar ~
Settings
\family default 
, then set the 
\family sans 
Alignment
\family default 
 to 
\family sans 
\bar under 
B
\bar default 
lock
\family default 
.
 This took care of it for me.
\layout Subsubsection

References
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{cite}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

A few things: 1) I have noticed some funny spacing in the reference entries
 in the text.
 When you enter the bibliography item data, make sure their is 
\emph on 
no
\emph default 
 space between the last author and the parenthesis setting off the year;
 
\emph on 
e.g.
 
\emph default 
type
\family typewriter 
 Ressler(1992)
\family default 
, not 
\family typewriter 
Ressler (1992)
\family default 
.
 2) I am really unhappy that I can't make 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
citet
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
citep
\family default 
 more automatic, but that would require changes to the LyX source code.
 For now you can do one of two things: a) enter all your citations using
 the built-in 
\family sans 
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Citation Reference
\family default 
 mechanism; at least you can take advantage of the automatic insertions.
 Then edit the exported LaTeX file by hand changing the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
cite
\family default 
 entries to the appropriate 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
citet
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
citep
\family default 
 commands before you submit it (
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
cite
\family default 
 is currently equivalent to 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
citet
\family default 
, so you wouldn't necessarily have to change those).
 Or b) you can simply enter all your citations as ERT using the same key
 for the argument that you used in the bibliography dialog, 
\emph on 
e.g.

\emph default 
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
citet{key}
\family default 
.
 Neither choice is pleasant, but until LyX's citation mechanism understands
 
\family typewriter 
natbib
\family default 
, we'll have to put up with it.
 3) Entering the references at all is not obvious.
 The easiest thing is to start typing your first reference at the end of
 the document, then mark it as type 
\family sans 
References
\family default 
.
 That will put a small gray box in front of what you just typed.
 Click on the box to fill in the rest of the information.
 For new references, go to the end of an existing reference and press return.
 That will create a new line with its own box, etc.
\layout Subsubsection

Including EPS files
\layout Standard

With all due respect to Chris Biemesderfer and the others who have helped
 to write the AASTeX package, the figure handling mechanism smells really
 foul.
 You can insert the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
plotone
\family default 
, etc.
\begin_inset ERT
status Inlined

\layout Standard

\backslash 
 
\end_inset 

commands as ERT into a Figure Float box, but I never have much luck getting
 the layout right.
 My advice would be to avoid all EPS inclusions in the manuscript you submit
 to the journal, but then use the standard LyX EPS file inclusion mechanism
 when you want to make your nicer looking preprints.
 LyX will insert a 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
usepackage{graphics}
\family default 
 command into the LaTeX preamble and handle the figures in the standard
 LaTeX2e way.
 Anyone who attempts to print your AASTeX 5.0 manuscript must have a LaTeX2e
 installation anyway, so why not take advantage of the infinitely better
 graphics handling mechanism? If they complain about LaTeX2e or the graphics
 package, point out that it appears in the second edition of Lamport (1994),
 so it was time to upgrade many years ago.
\layout Subsubsection

Things I could have done, but didn't
\layout Standard

There are a few 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 things I could have implemented, but chose not to.
 For instance, I saw no point in double-spacing the text in the LyX window,
 even though it is double-spaced in the paper manuscript.
 Also, I chose not to make separate layouts for the preprint and preprint2
 styles.
 Since I assume you will spend most of your time in the plain manuscript
 mode anyway, I decided not to chew up more disk space with this.
 If you feel strongly that I should make such layouts, I will adhere to
 the spirit of the rules laid out by the Mudgeeraba Creek Emu-Riding and
 Boomerang-Throwing Association:
\layout Quotation


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Decisions of the judges will be final unless shouted down by a really overwhelmi
ng majority of the crowd present.
 Abusive and obscene language may not be used by contestants when addressing
 members of the judging panel, or, conversely, by members of the judging
 panel when addressing contestants (unless struck by a boomerang).

 a paper using it.

Writing a paper
\layout Standard

As usual, the easiest way to write a paper is to start with a template.
 Click on 
\family sans 
\bar under

\bar default 
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New from 
\bar under 
T
\bar default 
emplate
\family default 
, then choose the 
\family typewriter 
ijmpd.lyx
\family default 
 template.
 This will give an (almost) empty document that includes the most common
 fields found in a manuscript.
 Simply overwrite the existing text (including the brackets, 
\family typewriter 
<>
\family default 
) with the correct information.
 You should keep in mind the following remarks.
\layout Enumerate

LyX won't let you change the font size and the page style of the document,
 because the ijmpd package does not allow such modifications.
\layout Enumerate

The ijmpd package requires that the language of the document should not
 be changed.
 Before previewing your paper, be sure that the babel package is not used.
 To do this, click on 
\family sans 
\bar under 
T
\bar default 
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

 are available (their use is obvious).
\layout Enumerate

Appendices may be added to the paper.
 LyX offers a special environment, called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Appendix
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which marks the beginning of the appendix.
 An appendix can contain normal sections, subsections, or subsubsections.
\layout Enumerate

The ijmpd package implements table captions quite differently than LyX does.
 As a result, a table created by LyX is printed correctly, but its caption
 is ignored.
 If you need table captions, you should implement the whole table float
 in a 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 file, then include this file to the LyX document (

Use of ERT

The use of ERT is optional, and is reduced to three commands, which affect
 the look of the page.
 If you started writing your paper by using the 
\family typewriter 
ijmpd.lyx
\family default 
 template, the ERT needed is already in its place; you usually don't need
 to delete it.
 You may only change the first ERT to specify the information printed to
 the top of odd and even pages (authors' names and short paper's title,
 respectively).
 This ERT must have the form

I can't imagine any good reason to do this.

 Each article must be included in the environment

article
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Unfortunately, this environment cannot be omitted, even if you write just
 one article.
 Therefore, each article starts with the command 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{article}
\family default 
 and, obviously, ends with the command 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{article}
\family default 
.
 Although this can be implemented in LyX, I didn't included it, since it
 looks ugly and can confuse the novice user.
 Therefore, you need to enter them directly and mark them as LaTeX code
 (the well-known 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

ERT
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
\layout Enumerate

Information given at the beginning of the article (i.e., title, subtitle,
 author, institution, running title, running author, abstract and keywords)
 must be included in an environment called

 This is not implemented in LyX, so you must enter title, subtitle etc.
 between two ERT lines (

 of the Koma-Script family.
 They are replacements for the standard document classes

\emph default 
document class are set in a bold sans serif font.
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

There is a big difference between the bold sans serif old cm fonts and new
 ec fonts, especially in the appearance of headings.
 In comparison, the ec bold sans serif fonts look a bit thin.
 Here the LaTeX package 
\family typewriter 
cmsd.sty by 
\family default 
\shape smallcaps 
Walter Schmidt
\shape default 
 helps to produce the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

usual

\end_inset 

 appearance when using the ec fonts.
\end_inset 

 The numbering of chapter headings is made in the same way as the numbering
 of section headings, that is without the extra line 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Chapter\SpecialChar \ldots{}

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 In addition, the appearance of the headings can be modified by using a
 number of options (in LyX to be entered in the field

 A detailed German description of these options can be found in the Koma-Script
 documentation 
\emph on

The main means in the Koma-Script document classes to design the type area
 are the options

The types 
\family sans 
Letter 
\family default

 It is possible to write any number of letters in one file.
 An 
\family sans

\family default

It could be seen as a matter of inconsequence, that the types 
\family sans 
Letter
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Opening
\family default 
 described above are not such input types as well.
 Because of the special meaning of those types, however, I have implemented
 them as ordinary paragraph types with a one letter mark in the left margin.
 Moreover, it would affect my feeling of symmetry, if the 
\family sans 
Opening
\family default 
 type and the 
\family sans 
Closing
\family default 
 type had such a serious different appearance.
\end_inset 

 The types must be used ahead of the corresponding 
\family sans 
Opening
\family default 
 type.
\layout Standard

An implementation of these types in a WYSIWYG fashion does not seem to make
 sense, because the real appearance of the produced letter does not only
 depend on the usage of the particular type, but also on other factors.
 For example, a signature entered in the 
\family sans 
Signature
\family default 
 type will in the standard behavior appear in the produced letter only,
 when in the same letter also a 
\family sans 
Closing
\family default 
 type is used.
 The entered value of the 
\family sans 
Telephone
\family default 
 type will in the standard behavior not appear in the produced letter at
 all.
 The possibility to design the letter`s heading freely is already indicated
 in a footnote above.
\layout Standard

The input types can also be used as empty paragraphs.
 This makes sense e.\SpecialChar ~
g.
 for the 
\family sans 
Signature
\family default 
 type.
 If the 
\family sans 
Signature
\family default 
 type is not used at all, in the standard behavior the value of the 
\family sans 
Name
\family default 
 type is used as signature, whereas if an empty 
\family sans 
Signature
\family default 
 type is used, no signature value is defined.
\layout Standard

By using the input types it is possible to write a letter template, containing
 filled input types with your personal dates (name, address, etc.) and empty
 input types for other dates you want to enter.
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Name
\family default 
: sender's name, in the standard behavior appears as a centered paragraph
 in small caps in the letter`s heading.
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Signature
\family default 
: sender's signature, in the standard behavior appears below the 
\family sans 
Closing
\family default 
 type.
 If no 
\family sans

\family default 
 type is used, the value of the 
\family sans 
Name
\family default 
 type appears instead.
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Address
\family default 
: sender's address, in the standard behavior appears in a centered paragraph
 in the letter`s heading below the sender's name.
\layout Itemize


\family sans

\family sans 
Place
\family default

\family sans

 line below the addressee's field.
 If an empty 
\family sans

\family default

 the 
\family sans

\family default

 If no

The new letter class: letter (koma-script v.2)
\layout Standard

by 
\noun on 
Jürgen Spitzmüller
\layout Standard
\added_space_top medskip \noindent 
Koma-Script version 2.8 has introduced a new letter class 
\family typewriter 
scrlttr2
\family default 
 which superceeds the now unsupported 
\family typewriter 
scrlettr
\family default 
.
 It has --- on the LaTeX side --- a completely new interface and is not
 compatible with the old class.
 Therefore, LyX supports both, though it is recommended to use the new class.
\layout Standard

This class covers the same functionality as 
\emph on 
letter (koma-script),
\emph default 
 and a few more.
 The basic items are 
\family sans 
Address
\family default 
 (receiver's address, same as 
\family sans 
Letter
\family default 
 in the old layout), 
\family sans 
Opening
\family default 
, and 
\family sans 
Closing
\family default 
.
 
\family sans 
NextAddress
\family default 
 will start a new letter (i.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
,
\end_inset 

e.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
 
\end_inset 

you can write several letters per document).
 New elements are sender's 
\family sans 
E-Mail
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
URL
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Fax
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Bank
\family default 
 and the possibility to use a 
\family sans 
Logo
\family default 
 (via 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
nsert\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
G
\bar default 
raphics
\family default 
) in the header.
\layout Standard

The biggest improvement is, though, that the letter's layout is configurable
 at almost any needs.
 This can be done via the preamble or with a special style file (Letter
 Class Option, extension 
\family typewriter 
*.lco
\family default 
), that will be read in as a class option.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

The KOMA package comes with some default 
\family typewriter 
*.lco
\family default 
 files.
 There is, for instance, a 
\family typewriter 
DIN.lco
\family default 
 file that follows german typesetting rules, or a 
\family typewriter 
KOMAold.lco
\family default 
 that provides the default layout of the old 
\family typewriter 
scrlettr
\family default 
 class.
 The latter can be loaded with the class option 
\family typewriter 
KOMAold
\family default 
, inserted via the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
L
\bar default

field.
\end_inset 

 Have a look at the 
\emph on 
koma-letter2
\emph default 
 template that is included in LyX for examples.
 A detailed description is to be found in the Koma-Script documentation
 (
\emph on 
scrguide
\emph default 
).
\layout Subsection

Problems
\layout Standard

Visualizing the Koma-Script document classes in LyX, the LyX internals cause
 some problems.
\layout Itemize

The chapter number of a 
\family sans 
Chapter
\family default 
 type appears on a line of its own above the chapter heading instead of
 appearing in the same line ahead of it.
 The cause for that is the LyX internal behavior for the labeltype 
\family sans 
Counter_Chapter
\family default 
 in the layout file.
\layout Itemize

The headings of the types 
\family sans 
Addchap
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Addsec
\family default 
 are only put in the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 LaTeX table of contents, but not in the LyX table of contents (
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
T
\bar default 
able\SpecialChar ~
of\SpecialChar ~
Contents
\family default 
).
\layout Itemize

The paragraphs in a 
\emph on 
letter
\emph default 
 document class appear in a skip separation mode, not indented.
 This is the standard behavior, no special LaTeX commands are needed for
 that.
 But in the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
 dialog the corresponding radio button indicates 
\family sans 
\bar under 
I
\bar default 
ndent
\family default 
.
 A 
\family sans 
S
\bar under 
k
\bar default 
ip
\family default 
 value always has the effect that extra LaTeX commands are inserted in the
 document to produce the gap, which is not what is wanted in this case.

Description
\layout Standard

These are the layout files for some of the journal formats used by Springer
 Verlag and listed on 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.springer.de/author/tex/help-journals.html}

\end_inset 

, where you should also go to fetch the class files (yes, these are LaTeX2e
 now!).
 It is a modular system: the things common to all journals are implemented
 in 
\family typewriter 
svjour.inc
\family default 
, which journal-specific layout files (such as, e.g., 
\family typewriter 
svjog.layout
\family default 
 for Journal of Geodesy) can include.
\layout Standard

This means that implementing support for any other Springer journal on this
 list is as simple as writing your own 
\family typewriter

\family default 
<myjournal>
\family typewriter 
.layout
\family default 
 file following the outline given in 
\family typewriter 
svjog.layout
\family default

\layout Standard

It is reasonably well tested only for the Journal of Geodesy.
 
\family typewriter 
svjour
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
svjog
\family default 
 come with the standard LyX distribution.
 Install the relevant class file (downloaded from Springer) in a proper
 directory, reconfigure LaTeX (in the teTeX case by running 
\family typewriter 
texhash
\family default 
, as root if necessary --- doesn't LyX take care of this?), reconfigure
 LyX and it should work.

Introduction
\layout Standard

This section describes how to use LyX to make slides for overhead projectors.
 There are two document classes that can do this: the default slides class
 and the 
\family sans 
Foil
\family default 
TeX slides class.
 This section documents the former.
\layout Standard

I'm going to say this again, nice and clear, so that there's no misunderstanding

\family sans

\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
or so I've been told repeatedly by its advocates.
 Having never used it, I have no idea if this claim is true or not.
\end_inset 

 which this section documents.
\layout Standard

This class is the LaTeX2e improvement of the old 
\noun on

 Every LaTeX2e distribution includes this class [which I'll just refer to
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans

\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 from now on], so you're bound to have it.
 As I noted earlier, there are other classes, such as 
\family sans 
foils
\family default 
, which also produce slides for overhead projectors and do a better job
 at it.
 However, there are some things which 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 can do which the others can't, such as generate overlays.
 Read on to learn more!
\layout Subsection

Getting Started
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:slidesetup}

\layout Standard

Obviously, to use this document class, you need to select 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
slides (default)
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 from the class list in the 
\family sans

 There are some other special things you should know about this class:
\layout Itemize

Don't bother changing the options 
\family sans 
Sides and Columns
\family default 
.
 They're not supported by the 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class, anyways.
\layout Itemize

The option 
\family sans 
\bar under 
P
\bar default 
age\SpecialChar ~
style
\family default 
 behaves a bit differently for this class.
 The possible choices and what they do are as follows:
\begin_deeper 
\layout Description


\family sans 
plain
\family default 
 The final output contains page numbers in the lower right corner.
\layout Description


\family sans 
headings
\family default 
 Like 
\family sans 
plain
\family default 
, but also prints out any time markers you've put in.
 This is the default.
\layout Description


\family sans 
empty
\family default 
 The final output contains no page numbers, time markers, or alignment markers.
\end_deeper 
\layout Itemize

The 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class has an extra option: 
\family typewriter 
clock
\family default 
.
 To use it, put 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
clock
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the extra class options.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

Using this options allows you to add time markers to 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
s.
 See section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:slideNote}

\end_inset 

 for more details.
\end_deeper 
\layout Standard

You can also use the template file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
slides.lyx
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to automatically set up a document to use the 
\family sans

\bar default 
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator
New\SpecialChar ~

\bar under

 to open your new document].
 The template file also contains some examples of the special paragraph
 environments used by this class.
 I'll describe those next.
\layout Subsection

Paragraph Environments
\layout Subsubsection

Supported Environments
\layout Standard

The first thing you'll notice when you start up a new 
\family sans 
slides 
\family default 
document is the font size and type: it's the equivalent of the size 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
Largest
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in the 
\family sans 
Sans\SpecialChar ~
Serif
\family default 
 font.
 This is also what's used in the output.
 Think of this as a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

visual cue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to remind you that this is a slide.
 Your final slides will use a larger font; ergo, you'll have less space.
 Of course, the larger default screen font isn't WYSIWYG, only a reminder.
\layout Standard

The next thing that becomes obvious is the changes to the paragraph environment
 pull-down box [at the far-left end of the toolbar].
 Most of the paragraph environments you're used to seeing are missing.
 There are also five new ones.
 That's because the 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class itself only supports certain paragraph environments:
\layout Itemize

\family sans

\layout Standard

All of the other standard environments, including the section-heading environmen
ts, aren't used in the 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class.
\layout Standard

On the other hand, you'll notice the following new environments:
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Slide
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Overlay
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
Note
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
InvisibleText
\layout Itemize


\family sans 
VisibleText
\layout Standard

These five are kind of quirky, due to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

feature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in LyX.
 You see, LyX doesn't permit you to nest any other paragraph environment
 into an empty environment.
 Now, that's fine and dandy, but it means that you wouldn't be able to start
 a slide with anything except plain text.
 To deal with this, I've performed a little 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

LaTeX magic.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 
\layout Subsubsection

Quirks of the New Environments
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:slideQuirk}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

All five of the new paragraph environments are somewhat quirky due to inherent
 limitiations in the current version of LyX.
 As I just mentioned, LyX forbids environments that begin with another environme
nt.
 To get around this, the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 environment isn't a paragraph environment as described in the 
\emph on 
User's Guide
\emph default 
.
 
\layout Standard

You should consider 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, and 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

pseudo-environments.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 They look like a section heading or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family sans 
Caption
\family default 
,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 but really begin a [and, if necessary, end the previous] paragraph environment.
 Likewise, treat 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

pseudo-commands.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 These two perform some action.
\layout Standard

A common feature of all five environments, 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
, is a rather long-ish label.
 The text following this label --- ordinarily the contents of the paragraph
 environment --- is utterly irrelevant for 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
.
 LyX completely ignores it.
 In fact, you can leave these five environments completely empty.
 
\layout Standard

While you don't 
\emph on 
have
\emph default 
 to put any text after the rather long-ish label, you might want to.
 This could be a short description of the contents of the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, for example.
 In that case, enter in your descriptive comment and hit 
\family sans 
Return
\family default 
 as you normally would.
\layout Standard

If, on the other hand, you don't want to enter in any descriptive text,
 you'll hit another LyX quirk.
 LyX, like nature, abhors a vacuum, and will not let you start a new paragraph
 environment until you put something in the old one.
 So, do this:
\layout Itemize

Start entering the text that will 
\emph on 
follow
\emph default 
 the new 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 or 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
.
 
\layout Itemize

Now move to the beginning of that paragraph.
 
\layout Itemize

Next, hit 
\family sans 
Return
\family default 
.
 
\layout Itemize

Finally, change this new, empty paragraph to a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 or 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
.
 
\layout Standard

Some future version of LyX will, hopefully, resolve this quirkiness\SpecialChar \ldots{}

 environment [in the manner described in section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:slideQuirk}

\end_inset 

] tells LyX to begin a new slide [duh].
 The label for this environment/
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

pseudo-command
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ASCII line,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in cool blue, followed by the label, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

NewSlide:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 Any text or paragraph environments that follow this one go on the new slide.
 It's that simple.
\layout Standard

Slides are probably the only time you'll need to forcibly end pages in LyX
 (this can be specified in the 
\family sans 
Paragraph Layout
\family default 
 dialog).
 In fact, you'll want to, once you finish entering the contents of one slide.
 If you've entered more text than can physically fit on a slide, the extra
 overflows onto a new slide.
 I don't recommend doing this, however, since the overflow slide won't have
 any page number on it.
 Furthermore, it may interfere with any 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 you've made to accompany the oversized 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

The 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 environments work the same way as the 
\family sans 
Slide 
\family default 
environment.
 They both create an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 followed by a label [
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

NewOverlay:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

NewNote:
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, respectively].
 The color is a stunning magenta instead of blue, and the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

ASCII line
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will look different, in style and in length.
 The label fonts of all three also differ from one another.
\layout Standard

As with a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, if the contents of a 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 or 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 exceed the physical size of a slide or sheet of paper, the extra will overflow
 onto a new sheet.
 Again, you should avoid this.
 It defeats the whole purpose of 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
s and 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
s.
\layout Subsubsection

Using 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 with 
\family sans 
Slide
\layout Standard

The idea behind an 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 is a slide that sits atop another slide.
 Perhaps you wish to discuss a figure on the main 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 before displaying the text associated with it.
 One way to accomplish this is tape a flap of dark paper over the part of
 the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 you want to display later.
 This method fails, however, if you wish to overlap one graph with another,
 for example.
 You would then have to fumble while speaking to align the two separate,
 overlapping 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
s to align the two graphs.
 The use of an 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 environment in both cases makes life much easier.
\layout Standard

Each 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 receives the page number of its 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

parent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, appended by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, etc.\SpecialChar ~
appended to the page number of the parent 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
 
\end_inset 

 Clearly, you want the contents of both the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 and the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 to each fit on a single physical slide! You should probably consider an
 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

part of
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
 Indeed, the LyX 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class provides a visual cue for this: the label at the start of an 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 is shorter than that at the start of a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
 Lastly, when you generate printable output, you'll find alignment markers
 in all four corners of both the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 page and its parent 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
 These will assist you in lining up the two physical slides.
\layout Standard

The major problem in overlaying two slides is aligning the contents of the
 two transparencies.
 How much space should you leave for that graph on the second slide? Worse
 still, what if you want a graph and a sentence on second slide, but there
 is text on the main transparency that goes in between them? You could try
 and insert vertical space of the right size.
 The better way is to use 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

As their names imply, 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
 are two command-like paragraph environments that make all subsequent text
 invisible and visible, respectively.
 Note from section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:slideQuirk}

\end_inset 

 that you don't place anything 
\emph on 
into
\emph default 
 these two environments, however.
 When you create an 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
, it inserts a centered, sky-blue label into the page reading 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

<Invisible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 For paragraphs following this label, the parts of the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 [or 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
; it doesn't matter which] where they would be contain instead blank space.
 
\layout Standard

For 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
, the corresponding centered label is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

<Visible Text Follows>
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in blazing green.
 Paragraphs following this label behave normally.
 Note that the beginning of a new 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, or 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 automatically shuts off an 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
.
 It's therefore not necessary to use 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
 at the end of a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

By now, it should be obvious how to create overlay transparencies using
 the proper combination of 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
 on a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
:
\layout Enumerate

Create a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, including everything that will appear on it, whether on the main slide
 or on the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
.
\layout Enumerate

Before each figure or paragraph that will appear only on the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, insert an 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 environment.
 If necessary, insert a 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
 environment after the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
-only text.
\layout Enumerate

Start an 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
 immediately following the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
\layout Enumerate

Copy the contents of this 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 into the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
.
\layout Enumerate

Within the 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, change all of the 
\family sans 
InvisibleText
\family default 
 lines to 
\family sans 
VisibleText
\family default 
 and vice-versa.
\layout Standard

That's it.
 You've just made an 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

There's one problem with the way I've designed the LyX 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class: you can't make text in the middle of a paragraph invisible, nor
 make text in the middle of an invisible paragraph visible again.
 To accomplish this feat, you'll need to use some inlined LaTeX codes.
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

The commands of interest are: 
\layout Itemize


\family typewriter

 }
\layout Itemize

 Here, too, the LyX

 class provides visual cues.
 The label for a

\family default 
 [yet longer than that of an 
\family sans

\family default

\family sans

\family default 
 is shockingly magenta.
 Additionally, the printed

 You can have multiple

\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
, and, as with 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
, you'll probably want to break up long 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
s so that they fit on a single sheet of paper.
\layout Standard

The purpose of a 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 is obvious: it contains anything additional you might want to say about
 a 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
 It could also be used as a sheet of reminders for a particular 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
 In the case of the latter, you might want to make use of time markers.
 Currently, the LyX 
\family sans 
slides
\family default 
 class has no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

native
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 support for time markers, a 
\noun on 
Sli
\noun default 
TeX feature.
 So, you'll have to resort to using the LaTeX codes.
\layout Standard

To use time markers, you'll need to specify the extra class option 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
clock
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 [see section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:slidesetup}

\end_inset 

].
 This option turns on timing marks, which will appear in the lower-left-hand
 corner of every 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 you generate.
 To set what appears in the time marker, you use the LaTeX commands 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
settime{}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
addtime{}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 The arguments of both commands are time measured in seconds.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
settime{}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 sets the time marker to a given time.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
addtime{}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 increments the time marker by the specified amount.
 Using time markers and 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
s in this fashion, you can remind yourself how much time to spend on a particula
r 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

There's one last feature to describe.
 Clearly, you'd like to print out all of your 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
s and 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
s on transparencies while printing all of your 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
s on plain paper.
 However, a 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
 
\emph on 
must
\emph default 
 follow the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
 with which it is associated.
 What's a person to do?
\layout Standard

Luckily, there are two LaTeX commands that allow you to select what to print
 out.
 Both must be placed into the preamble of your document.
 The command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
onlyslides{
\backslash 
slides}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 will cause the output to contain only the 
\family sans 
Slide
\family default 
s and 
\family sans 
Overlay
\family default 
s.
 Correspondingly, the command 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
onlynotes{
\backslash 
notes}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 prevents the output of anything but 
\family sans 
Note
\family default 
s.
 I'd advise placing both commands in the preamble and initially comment
 both out.
 You can then preview your entire presentation as you write.
 When you're done writing, you can then uncomment one of the two to select
 what you want to print.
 I like to uncomment 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
onlyslides{

 and print to a

 I can then send either file to a printer, loading transparencies or plain

Building a Set of Foils
\layout Standard

This section will give a simple introduction to using the different environments
 to build a set of foils.
 If you want to see an example set of foils take a look at the 
\family typewriter 
Foils.lyx
\family default 
 file accessible from the 
\family sans

Give It a Title Page
\layout Standard

Unlike other classes that provide 
\family sans 
Title
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Author
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Date
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Abstract
\family default 
 environments, 
\family sans 
foils
\family default 
 creates the title on a page of its own.
 If you leave out the 
\family sans 
Date
\family default 
 environment LaTeX will substitute the current date (every time you regenerate
 the output).
\layout Subsubsection

Start a New Foil
\layout Standard

As I mentioned earlier, there are four ways of starting a new foil.
 For portrait foils you should use 
\family sans 
Foilhead
\family default 
 or 
\family sans 
ShortFoilhead.

\family default 
 The difference between these two environments is the amount of space between
 the title of the foil (the foilhead) and the body of the foil.
\layout Standard

Landscape foils are generated using the 
\family sans 
Rotatefoilhead
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
ShortRotatefoilhead
\family default 
 environments.
 Again the only difference is the spacing between foilhead and body.
 Both of the short versions have 0.5 inches less separation between the foilhead
 and the body.
 
\layout Standard

One problem with the support for landscape foils is the requirement that
 you have to use the 
\family typewriter 
dvips
\family default 
 driver to generate the PostScript® output otherwise the foils won't be
 rotated.
 It is possible to get landscape foils even if you haven't got the 
\family typewriter 
dvips
\family default 
 driver provided you can feed your foils sideways through your printer ;-)
\layout Subsubsection

Theorems, Lemmas, Proofs and more
\layout Standard

Due to a small bug in LyX you can't have two of the same type of these environme
nts directly following each other.
 They must be separated by something.
 If you try, you will just be extending the previous environment as if you
 had merged the two environments together.
 So, how do you get around this problem? The simplest option is to insert
 some text between the two environments or add a 
\family sans 
LaTeX
\family default 
 environment between the two with just a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
%
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in it.
 This will force LyX to produce two separate environments and hence the
 correct LaTeX output.
 An example is provided in the example file included with the LyX distribution.
 Remember, this problem only occurs if you are trying to place two of the
 same type of theorem-like environments one directly after the other.
\layout Subsubsection

Lists
\layout Standard

You get all the commonly supported list styles found in other classes as
 well as two new ones.
 I'll only describe the new ones here.
 If you want to find out more about the other list environments check out
 the 
\emph on 
User's Guide.

\emph default 
 If you intend to use itemized lists you might also want to read about the
 
\family sans 
Itemize\SpecialChar ~
Bullet\SpecialChar ~
Selection
\family default 
 dialog described above in section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:bullet}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

The two new list styles, 
\family sans 
TickList 
\family default 
and 
\family sans 
CrossList
\family default 
, are designed to make it easier for you to create lists of do's and don'ts
 or right and wrong by providing dedicated environments that use a tick
 or a cross as the label of the list.
 These lists are in fact dedicated variants of the 
\family sans 
Itemize
\family default 
 environment.
 They do however require that you have the 
\family typewriter 
psnfss
\family default 
 packages installed.
\layout Subsubsection

Figures and Tables
\layout Standard


\family sans 
Foil
\family default 
TeX redefines the floating tables and figures so that they appear exactly
 where they are in the text rather than pushing them to the top of the page
 or to some user specified location.
 In fact if you change the float placement settings they are simply ignored.
\layout Subsubsection

Page Headers and Footers
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:foilfoot}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard


\family sans 
My\SpecialChar ~
Logo
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Restriction
\family default 
 are two commands used to control the left-footer text string.
 The first is meant to allow you to include a graphic logo on your foils
 and defaults to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

-Typeset by 
\family sans 
Foil
\family default 
TeX-
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 While the second is meant to provide a classification for the audience,
 
\emph on 
e.g.

\emph default 
 Confidential.
 It is empty by default.
\layout Standard

The remaining page corners can be filled by
\family sans

\family sans

All the commands mentioned below need to be set in a

 environment or as 
\family sans

\family default

\layout Subsubsection

Lengths
\layout Standard

All lengths are adjusted using the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
setlength{
\family default 
\emph on 
lengthname
\family typewriter 
\emph default 
}{
\family default 
\emph on 
newlength
\family typewriter 
\emph default 
}
\family default 
 command.
 Where 
\emph on 
lengthname
\emph default 
 should be replaced by the name given to the length you want to change and
 
\emph on 
newlength
\emph default 
 is the length value.
 All lengths should be specified in units of length such as inches (
\family typewriter 
in
\family default 
), millimeters (
\family typewriter 
mm
\family default 
) or points (
\family typewriter 
pt
\family default 
) or relative to some document or font-based length such as 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
textwidth
\family default 
.
 
\layout Standard

It's possible to change the spacing between a foilhead and the body of the
 foil by adjusting the length specified by 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
foilheadskip
\family default 
.
 For example, to make 
\emph on 
all
\emph default 
 foilheads 0.5 inches closer to their bodies put the following in the preamble:
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
setlength{
\backslash 
foilheadskip}{-0.5in}
\layout Standard

The spacings around floats can be adjusted by setting these lengths:
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
abovefloatskip 
\family default 
Separation between the text and the top of the float
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
abovecaptionskip 
\family default 
Separation between the float and the caption
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
belowcaptionskip 
\family default 
Separation between the caption and the following text
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
captionwidth
\family default 
 You can make the captions narrower than the surrounding text by adjusting
 this length.
 Best done relative to 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
textwidth
\family default 
.
\layout Standard

There are also several title page related lengths that you may find useful
 if you have a long title or several authors:
\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
abovetitleskip
\family default 
 Separation from headers to 
\family sans

\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash

\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter 

\backslash

\layout List
\labelwidthstring MMMMMMMMMMM


\family typewriter

\layout List

\family typewriter 

\backslash 
dateabstractskip

\layout Standard

The last length related command affects all the list environments.
 If you place
\family typewriter 
 
\backslash 
zerolistvertdimens
\family default 
 
\emph on 
inside
\emph default 
 a list environment then all the vertical spacing between the list items
 is removed.
 Note that this is a command not a length so it doesn't require 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
setlength
\family default 
 like the stuff mentioned above.
\layout Subsubsection

Headers and Footers
\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
LogoOn
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
LogoOff
\family default 
 commands control whether the logo in the 
\family sans 
MyLogo
\family default 
 definition appear on a given page.
 If you put 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
LogoOff
\family default 
 in the preamble then none of the foils will have the logo on them.
 If you don't want the logo on a particular page place the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
LogoOff
\family default 
 directly after the foilhead of that page and the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
LogoOn
\family default 
 directly after the next foilhead.
\layout Standard

If you decide to use the 
\family sans 
fancy
\family default 
 page style setting in the 
\family sans 
Document\SpecialChar ~
Layout
\family default 
 dialog you should probably add 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
let
\backslash 
headwidth
\backslash 
textwidth
\family default 
 to your preamble so headers and footers on landscape pages are correctly
 placed when rotated.
 This is due to some clashes between the page layouts provided by the 
\family sans 
fancyheadings
\family default 
 package and the 
\family sans 
foils
\family default 
 class.

Installation
\layout Standard

All you need to do is install RevTeX 4, as described in the package's README
 file.
 the package can be found at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[The RevTeX 4 Web Site]{http://publish.aps.org/revtex4/}

\end_inset 

.
 Install it somewhere that LaTeX can see it.
 Test it by trying to LaTeX a short RevTeX 4 document in some random directory
 (i.e., not the directory where you installed the class file.) Then, if you
 reconfigure LyX, it will find the class file and let you use the RevTeX4
 textclass.
\layout Standard

Probably the easiest way to get started is either to import a RevTeX 4 document
 using 
\family typewriter

Layouts
\layout Standard

The layouts basically correspond to the commands in RevTeX4.0.
 For example, the Email layout corresponds to

 Note that (at least as of RevTeX 4.0 Beta), the 
\family sans 
Address
\family default 
 and 
\family sans 
Affiliation
\family default 
 layouts are exactly equivalent, so you shouldn't need to use both.

Important Notes
\layout Standard

There are a couple of important unique aspects of RevTeX 4 which might cause
 bugs that will be even more confusing in LyX.
\layout Standard

In RevTeX, the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
thanks
\family default 
 command goes 
\emph on 
outside
\emph default 
 the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
author
\family default 
 command.
 The LyX equivalent is that there is a separate Thanks layout.
 Do 
\emph on 
not
\emph default 
 write footnotes in the 
\family sans 
Author
\family default 
 layout, or weird things may happen.
 See the RevTeX 4 documentation for more details.
\layout Standard

Also, the 
\family sans 
Author\SpecialChar ~
Email
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Author\SpecialChar ~
URL
\family default 
, and 
\family sans 
Thanks
\family default 
 layouts must be placed 
\emph on

\emph default 
 the 
\family sans 
Author
\family default 
 layout and the corresponding 
\family sans 
Address
\family default 
 (or equivalent 
\family sans 
Affiliation
\family default 
) layout.
 If you put the 
\family sans 
Thanks
\family default 
 after the 
\family sans 
Address
\family default 
, the LaTeX won't compile.
\layout Subsection

Drawbacks
\layout Standard

The main problem with this layout is that you can't use the optional arguments
 to layouts like Email and Title.
 (The problem is not unique to this layout; you can't use optional arguments
 to the Section layouts either.) This means that after you export that file
 to LaTeX (which you'll need to do eventually to send it in to APS), you'll
 need to edit the LaTeX file with a text editor to add the optional arguments
 to set, e.g., the running title for the page headers.
 Lacking these layouts makes the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
altaffiliation
\family default 
 (and the equivalent 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
altaddress
\family default 
) useless, so the corresponding layouts don't exist, and will have to be
 added by hand.

Elsevier Journals
\layout Standard

\noun on 
Rod Pinna
\layout Standard

Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.
 provides a standard LaTeX document class (
\family typewriter 
elsart.cls
\family default 
) for submitting articles to their various journals.
 The style file can be downloaded directly from their web site: 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://authors.elsevier.com/}

\end_inset 

.
 Instructions are supplied along with the class file, which details the
 requirements of the publishers.
 LyX includes package that allows for the use of this class, by a layout
 and a template file.
 Installation of the class file is the same as for any other LaTeX package;
 instructions are provided in the Elsevier documentation.
\layout Standard

To make use of 
\family typewriter 
elsart.cls
\family default 
, a file 
\family typewriter 
elsart.layout
\family default 
 is supplied.
 As the Elsevier class file is based mainly on the standard article class,
 most of the normal functionality is provided.
 The Elsevier class defines a number of mathematical environments, which
 are similar to the AMS environments.
 These commands are all described in the Elsevier documentation, and are
 available in LyX.
\layout Standard

The easiest way to use the Elsevier style is to base documents on the included
 template file.
 It is best not to use options such as fancy headings or the geometry package,
 as elements such as these are defined by Elsevier in their style file.
 Ideally, no extra packages except those mentioned in the Elsevier documentation
 should be used.
 Essentially, Elsevier require as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

clean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 a 
\begin_inset ERT

\layout Standard

\backslash 
LaTeX
\end_inset 

 file as possible, as their intention is to take the supplied file and replace
 the class file with one for the particular journal to which the paper has
 been submitted.
 This also means that not too much time should be spent on the formating
 of the document.
 When it comes to be published, this will change anyway.
 The rest of the usage for this layout is substantially the same as for
 the normal article class.
 For details of what Elsevier do and don't allow, refer to their documentation.

Memoir
\layout Standard

By 
\noun on 
Jürgen Spitzmüller
\layout Subsection

Overview
\layout Standard

Memoir is a very powerful and constantly evolving class.
 It has been designed with regard to fictional and non-fictional literature.
 Its aim is to let the user have maximum control over the typesetting of
 his document.
 Memoir is based on the standard book class, but it can also emulate the
 article class (see below).
\layout Standard

Peter Wilson, the developer of Memoir, is known as the author of lots of
 useful packages in the LaTeX world.
 Most of them have been merged with Memoir.
 Therefore, it is much easier to layout the table of contents, appendices,
 chapter designs and such.
 LyX, though, does not support all of these goodies natively.
 Some of them might be added to forthcoming releases
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

You are invited to send suggestions to 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org}

\end_inset 

.
\end_inset 

, lots will probably never, due to the limitations of LyX's framework.
 Of course you can still use all features with the help of some native LaTeX
 commands (ERT

\end_inset 

).
 In this section, we can only list those features which are natively supported
 by LyX.
 For detailed descriptions (and for the rest of features) we are recommending
 to have a look at the detailed manual of the Memoir class

\end_inset 

, which is not only a user guide for the class, but also both a comprehensive
 description on good typesetting and a superb example for good typesetting
 itself.
\layout Subsection

Basic features and restrictions
\layout Standard

Memoir supports basically all features of the standard book classes.
 There are, however, some differences, as follows:
\layout Description

Font\SpecialChar ~
sizes: Memoir has a broader range of font sizes: 9, 10, 11, 12, 14,
 17
\layout Description

Page\SpecialChar ~
style: The fancy page style is not supported, due to a command clash
 between Memoir and the fancyhdr package (they are both defining a command
 with the same name, which confuses LaTeX).
 Instead, Memoir comes with a bunch of own page styles (see 
\family sans 
Layout\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Page\SpecialChar ~
Style
\family default 
).
 If you want to use these for the chapter pages, you have to use the command
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
chapterstyle
\family default 
 in the main text or in preamble (e.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
,
\end_inset 

g.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
 
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
chapterstyle{companion}
\family default 
).
\layout Description

Sectioning: Sectionings (chapter, section, subsection etc.) are coming with
 an optional argument in the standard classes.
 With this, you can specify an alternative version of the title for the
 table of contents and the headers (for instance, if the title is too long).
 In LyX, you can do this via 
\family sans 
Insert\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Short\SpecialChar ~
Title
\family default 
 at the beginning of a chapter/section.
 Memoir features a second optional argument and thus separates the table
 of contents from the header.
 You can define three variants of a title with this: one for the main text,
 one for the table of contents, and one for the headers.
 Unfortunately, LyX does not support two optional arguments yet.
 But you can fool it.
 Just insert a pair of brackets in ERT-Mode (
\family sans 
C-l
\family default 
) between the first and the second argument.
 That is, type 
\emph on 
<short title for the toc>
\emph default 
 
\family typewriter 
][
\family default 
 
\emph on 
<short title for the headers> 
\emph default 
in the Short Title inset (where 
\family typewriter 
][
\family default 
 is in TeX-Mode).
\layout Description

TOC/LOT/LOF: In the standard classes (and in many other classes), the table
 of contents, the list of figures and the list of table start a new page
 automatically.
 Memoir does not follow this route.
 You have to insert a page break yourself, if you want to have one.
\layout Description

Titlepage: For some unknown reason, Memoir uses pagination on the title
 page (in the standard classes, title pages are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

empty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, i.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
,
\end_inset 

e.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
 
\end_inset 

without pagina).
 If you want an empty title page, type 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
aliaspagestyle{title}{empty} 
\family default 
in the preamble.
\layout Description

Article: With the class option 
\emph on 
article 
\emph default 
(to be inserted in 
\family sans 
Layout\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Document\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Extra\SpecialChar ~
Options
\family default 
), you can emulate article style.
 That is, counters (footnotes, figures, tables etc.) will not be reset on
 new chapters, chapters don't start a new page (but are---in contrary to
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 article classes---still allowed), parts, though, use their own page, as
 in book.
\layout Description

Oldfontcommands: By default, Memoir does not allow the use of the deprecated
 font commands, which have been used in the old LaTeX version 2.09 (e.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
,
\end_inset 

g.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash 
 
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
rm
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
it
\family default 
).
 It produces an error and stops LaTeX whenever such a command appears.
 The class option 
\emph on 
oldfontcommands
\emph default 
 reallows the commands and spits out warnings instead (which does at least
 not stop LaTeX).
 Since a lot of packages and particularly BibTeX style files are still using
 those commands, we have decided to use this option by default.
\layout Subsection

Extra features
\layout Standard

We will only describe the features supported by LyX (which is not much currently
).

\layout Description

Abstract: You may wonder why an abstract is an extra feature.
 Well, it is in book class.
 Usually books don't have abstracts.
 Memoir, however, has.
 You can use it whereever and how often you like.
\layout Description

Chapterprecis: You may know this from belletristic: The contents of a chapter
 is shortly described below the title and also in the table of contents
 (e.
\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash

\begin_inset ERT
status Collapsed

\layout Standard

\backslash

\emph on 
Our hero arrives in Troia; he loses some friends; he finds others
\emph default 
).
 Chapterprecis does exactly this.
 It is therefore only sensible below a chapter.
\layout Description

Epigraph: An epigraph is a smart slogan or motto at the beginning of a chapter.
 The epigraph environment provides an elegant way of typesetting such a
 motto.
 The motto itself (text) and its author (source) are divided by a short
 line.
 Unfortunately, we have to fool LyX a bit here again, since the environment
 needs two arguments (text and source).
 In this case, we have to use curly brackets (in TeX mode) between the two
 arguments: 
\emph on 
<smart slogan>
\emph default 
 
\family typewriter 
}{
\family default 
 
\emph on 
<author of the slogan>.
\layout Description

Poemtitle: Memoir has lots of possibilities to typeset poetry (up to very
 complex figurative poems).
 Lyx can only support a few of them.
 One is poemtitle, which is a centered title for poems, which will also
 be added to the table of contents (verse is the standard environment for
 poems.
 Memoir has some enhanced versions of verse, but you need to use ERT, because
 they have to be nested inside regular verse environments, which is not
 possible with LyX).
\layout Description

Poemtitle*: Same as poemtitle, but it adds no entry to the table of contents.

LaTeX
\layout Standard

Translating from LaTeX into LyX is performed by a Perl script called reLyX.
 Although it is a standalone program which can be called from the command
 line, LyX will call it automatically when a LaTeX document is imported.
 See section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:reLyX}

 for a complete description.
 There are no user tunable parameters for reLyX within LyX.
\layout Subsection

ASCII Text
\layout Standard

When importing plain ASCII text, there are two methods of reading the file.
 Importing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

as lines
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 preserves all the linebreaks in the ASCII; to LyX, then, each line looks
 like a paragraph.
 Importing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

as paragraphs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 assumes that consecutive lines separated by only a single linebreak form
 a single paragraph.
 Successive linebreaks with no intervening text are thus assumed to be paragraph
 delimiters.

 any version of LyX is to save the document as a Postscript® file, then

 Starting with version 1.1.6, the menu item

 Also, as of version 1.1.6, there is a better method that will generate much

With pdfLaTeX you need to convert your eps figures to PDF (see Section\SpecialChar ~

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

The problem is that bitmap fonts are displayed poorly by Acrobat Reader.
 When creating a PDF from the LyX file, you need to use outline font instead
 of the default bitmap fonts (in fact, you should also use outline fonts
 for Postscript files).
 Recent LaTeX distributions come with Postscript® Type 1 version of the
 standard (Computer Modern) fonts.
 pdfLaTeX uses these font by default.
 Dvips doesn't use these fonts by default, so to make it use them, add the
 following to lines to your 
\family typewriter 
~/.dvipsrc
\family default 
 file
\layout LyX-Code

p+ psfonts.cmz
\layout LyX-Code

p+ psfonts.amz
\layout Standard

If the default LaTeX font encoding (OT1) is used, nothing else need to be
 done.
 However, if the T1 font encoding is used, then LaTeX uses the newer EC
 fonts, for which there are no Type1 version.
 The solution is to use the ae package which emulates T1 coded fonts using
 the standard CM fonts.
 This is done by adding 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
usepackage{ae,aecompl}
\family default 
 to the preamble of the LyX file.
 However, some glyphs are missing from the CM fonts (e.g.
 eth, thorn), and they are taken from the EC fonts.
 Therefore you get these glyphs as bitmaps.
\layout Standard

Note: LyX uses by default the T1 font encoding.
 If you wish to use the default font encoding (this is not recommended,
 unless you only write English documents), clear the field 
\family sans

encoding
\family default 
 in preferences (tabs 
\family sans 
Outputs
\family default 
, 
\family sans

\layout Standard

An alternate option is to use the standard Postscript® fonts instead of
 the Computer Modern fonts.
 To do that, you need to select 
\family sans 
pslatex

 as the global font in the document layout dialog.
 When using the Postscript® fonts, the result PDF file is smaller as the
 fonts are not saved into the file.
 Furthermore, the Postscript® fonts include all T1 glyphs.
 On the other hand, the Postscript® fonts have no bold symbol font, so poor
 man's bold must be used (see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:pdfbold}

\end_inset 

).
 The Postscript® fonts also look different from the Computer Modern fonts.
\layout Standard

To sum up, both the Computer Modern and the Postscript® fonts gives good
 results (with few exceptions).
 The decision of which one to use is a matter of taste.

Custom
\layout Standard

Custom exports are possible if you have some particularly weird format you
 wish to convert to, assuming you have the relevant converter, of course.
 The format of the 
\emph on

\emph default 
 file can be chosen in the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
E
\bar default 
xport\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
C
\bar default 
ustom 
\family default 
dialog; LyX will automatically convert the file to this point, then feed
 it to your custom converter.
 The possible values are all formats that LyX can produce from its own documents.
 
\layout Standard

The converter command is also specified in the dialog.It should be a completely
 qualified command line which uses the variable 
\family typewriter 
$$FName
\family default 
 to specify the name of the file.
 If this variable is not given, then the file will be sent to the standard
 input of your command.
 You may have to apply a bit of ingenuity to escape this sequence correctly
 so that it is compatible with your shell.
 
\layout Standard

While it is not possible to save this command using the 
\family sans 
Preferences 
\family default

Description
\layout Subsubsection

Introduction
\layout Standard

reLyX will create a LyX file 
\emph on 
dir/foo.lyx
\emph default 
 from the LaTeX file 
\emph on 
dir/foo.tex
\emph default 
 (unless the 
\series bold 
-o
\series default 
 option is used).
\layout Standard

Suffixes 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 
.ltx
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
.latex
\family default 
 are supported.
 If 
\emph on 
inputfile
\emph default 
 does not exist and does not have one of these suffixes, reLyX will try
 to translate 
\emph on 
inputfile.tex
\emph default 
.
 (This is similar to the behavior of LaTeX.)
\layout Standard

The purpose of reLyX is to translate 
\shape italic 
well-behaved
\shape default 
 LaTeX2e into LyX.
 If your LaTeX file doesn't compile---or if you do weird things, like redefining
 standard LaTeX commands---it may choke.
 LaTeX209 will often be translated correctly, but it's not guaranteed.
\layout Standard

reLyX has some bugs and lacks a few features.
 However, its main goals are:
\layout Itemize

Get through a well-behaved LaTeX2e file without crashing
\layout Itemize

Translate a lot of that file.
\layout Itemize

Localize the parts that can't be translated and copy them in TeX mode
\layout Standard

It achieves these main goals pretty well on most files.
\layout Standard

There are many improvements that can and will be made to reLyX in the future.
 However, we wanted to get reLyX out there early on, to make it easier for
 new LyX users to read in their existing LaTeX files.
\layout Subsubsection

Usage
\layout Standard

Here's a more lengthy description of what you should do to translate a LaTeX
 document into LyX.
\layout Itemize

Run reLyX.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

reLyX will inform you of its progress and give any warnings to stderr, so
 if you don't want any output at all, try (in csh) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
reLyX foo.tex >& /dev/null
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or (in bash) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
reLyX foo.tex
\family default 
 
\family typewriter 
2>&1 >/dev/null
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 You should NOT redirect standard output to 
\family typewriter 
foo.lyx
\family default 
.
 
\end_deeper 
\layout Itemize

Run LyX on the resulting .lyx file.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

In theory, most of the file will have been translated, and anything that's
 untranslatable will be highlighted in red (TeX mode).
 In theory, LyX will be able to read in the file, and to create printed
 documents from it, because all that untranslated red stuff will be passed
 directly back to LaTeX, which LyX  uses as a backend.
 Unfortunately, reality doesn't always reflect theory.
 If reLyX crashes, or LyX cannot read the generated LyX file, see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:relyx-bugs}

\end_inset 

 or the 
\family typewriter 
BUGS
\family default 
 file.
\end_deeper 
\layout Itemize

Change things that are in ERT boxes (TeX code) by hand in LyX.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

As mentioned above, you should be able to print out the LyX file even without
 doing this.
 However, changing a command in TeX mode to the corresponding LyX object
 will allow you to take advantage of LyX's WYSIWYM editing.
\layout Standard

reLyX is not guaranteed to create a LyX file which generates exactly the
 same output as the LaTeX file, but it should come close.
 reLyX will generally err on the side of translating less to ensure that
 dvi or ps files are accurate, even though this leads to more 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

evil red text
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 and less WYSIWYM.
\end_deeper 
\layout Itemize

PROOFREAD THE DOCUMENT!!
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

I'm sure you were planning on doing this anyway, but it's particularly important
 after translating a LaTeX document.
 reLyX is, at least now, better at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

macro-translating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (translating the whole document) than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

micro-translating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (translating every little detail).
 For example, you may see extra spaces or deleted spaces.
 Space handling has improved, but it's not perfect.
\end_deeper 
\layout Subsubsection

What reLyX Can Handle

reLyX understands many LaTeX commands.
 It will translate:

\layout Itemize

arguments to certain untranslatable commands (e.g.
 
\family typewriter

\layout Standard

Some of this support may not be 100% yet.
 See below for details
\layout Standard

reLyX copies math (almost) verbatim from your LaTeX file.
 Luckily, LyX reads  in LaTeX math, so (almost) any math which is supported
 by LyX should work just fine.
 A few math commands which are not supported by LyX will be replaced with
 their equivalents, e.g., 
\family typewriter 

\backslash

\family default 
 is converted to 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
rightarrow
\family default

 See the section on 
\shape italic 
Syntax Files
\shape default 
 for more details.
\layout Standard

reLyX will also copy any preamble commands (i.e., anything before 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{document}
\family default 
) verbatim, so fancy stuff you've got in your preamble should be conserved
 in dvi and printed documents, although it will not of course show up in
 the LyX window.
 Check the preamble to make sure.

 reLyX is careful to copy

\shape default 
 in this case, including comments and whitespace.
\layout Itemize

some unknown (e.g., user-defined) environments and commands
\layout Standard

reLyX copies unknown commands, along with their arguments, verbatim into
 the LyX file.
 Also, if it sees a 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{foo}
\family default 
 where it doesn't recognize the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

foo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 environment, it will copy verbatim until it sees 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{foo}
\family default 
 (unless you use the 
\series bold 
-r
\series default 
 option).
 Hopefully, then, most of these unknown commands won't cause reLyX to break;
 they'll merely require you to do some editing once you've loaded the file
 up in LyX.
  That should be less painful than editing either the 
\family typewriter 
.tex
\family default 
 or the 
\family typewriter 
.lyx
\family default 
 file using a text editor.

Since reLyX is relatively new, it's got a number of problems.
  As it matures, these bugs will be squished.

If reLyX is choking on something, or LyX can't read it after reLyX translates
 it, the best thing to do is to put 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{reLyXskip}
\family default 
 after it.
 I call this a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

skip
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 block.
 reLyX will copy this block exactly, in TeX mode.
 Then edit the resulting LyX file, and translate the unknown stuff by hand.
 The

\family default 
 environment is magical; the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin

 commands will not be put into the LyX file.
\layout Itemize


\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Exact
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 copying of unknown environments and commands isn't quite exact.
 Specifically, newlines and comments may be lost.
 This will yield ugly LyX, but in almost all cases the output will be the
 same.
 However, certain parts of the file will be copied perfectly, including
 whitespace and comments.
 This includes: the LaTeX preamble, 
\family typewriter 
verbatim
\family default 
 environments and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
verb
\family default 
 commands, and skip blocks.
\layout Itemize

reLyX translates only a few options to the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
documentclass
\family default 
 command.
 (Specifically 1[012]pt, [letter|legal|executive|a4|a5|b5]paper, [one|two]side,
 landscape, and [one|two]column.) Other options are placed in the extra class
 options field in the

\bar default

\bar under

More importantly, reLyX doesn't translate 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
usepackage
\family default 
 commands, margin  commands, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
newcommand
\family default 
s, or, in fact, anything else from the preamble.
 It simply copies them into the LaTeX preamble.
 If you have margin commands in your preamble, then the LyX file will generate
 the right margins.
 However, these margins will override any margins you set in the LyX

 incorrectly (although the stuff in the environment should translate normally).
\layout Standard

reLyX is hopefully rather robust.
 As mentioned above, it may not translate your file perfectly, but it shouldn't
 crash.
 If it does crash---and the problem is not one of those mentioned above
 or in the 
\emph on 
BUGS
\emph default 
 file---see Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:relyx-bug-reports}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Subsubsection

What LyX Can't Handle
\layout Standard

LyX itself is missing a couple features, such that even if reLyX translates
 things perfectly, LyX may still have trouble reading it.
 If you really need these features, you can export your final document as
 LaTeX, and put them back in.
 See 
\emph on 
BUGS
\emph default 
 for more details on these bugs.
\layout Itemize

For a number of commands, LyX does not support the optional argument.
 Examples include 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
sqrt
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
chapter
\family default 
 (and other sectioning commands), and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 

\backslash 

\family default 
.
 reLyX will automatically discard the optional arguments with a warning
 to stdout.
 LyX also ignores the width argument for the 
\family typewriter 
thebibliography
\family default 
 environment.
\layout Itemize

Centering (or right or left justifying) works on full paragraphs.
\layout Itemize

LyX support for tables isn't perfect.
 For complicated tables, use a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

skip
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 block, so that they will be copied in TeX mode.
\layout Itemize

The LyX math editor can't handle the AMS-LaTeX math environments align,
 split, etc.
 So those environments will be copied in TeX mode.
 You can change 
\family typewriter 
equation*
\family default 
 environments to the exactly equivalent displaymath, and then they will
 be translated correctly.
\layout Subsection

Examples
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 
reLyX -df -o 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

my/dir
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 -r 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

myenv
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 foo.tex > foo.debug
\layout Standard

The above will create a file my/dir/foo.lyx from foo.tex, overwriting if necessary.
  When it finds a 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{myenv} ...
 
\backslash 
end{myenv}
\family default 
 block, it will translate the stuff within the block, but copy the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end
\family default 
 commands in TeX mode.
  Finally, I'm going to keep the temporary files around (they will also
 be in my/dir/) and output lots of debugging information into the file foo.debug.

Bug Reports
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:relyx-bug-reports}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

If reLyX is crashing or otherwise acting strangely---in ways other than
 those described in Section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:relyx-bugs}

\end_inset 

 or the bug tracker---then please run reLyX
\series bold 
 -d
\series default 
.
  That will allow you to figure out where in the reLyXing process it crashed.
 That, in turn, will allow you to write a better bug report, which will
 allow the developers to fix it more quickly and easily.
\layout Standard

Bug reports should be sent to the LyX developers' mailing list.
 Its address is currently 
\family typewriter 
lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org
\family default 
.
 If you are running reLyX on a huge file, please do not send all of the
 output in your bug report.
 Just include the last ten or twenty lines of output, along with the piece
 of the LaTeX file it crashed on.
  Or, even better, attach a small but complete file which causes the same
 problem as your original file.
\layout Subsubsection

Implementation Details:
\layout Standard

reLyX makes several 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

passes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 in order to translate a TeX file.
 On each pass, it creates one or two files.
\layout Description

Pass\SpecialChar ~
0 \SpecialChar ~

\newline 
Before doing anything, read the syntax file (or files).
\layout Description

Pass\SpecialChar ~
1a \SpecialChar ~

\newline 
Split preamble (anything before a 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{document}
\family default 
 command) off the rest of the file.
 It saves the two pieces in separate files.
 This is necessary because there may be very strange stuff in a preamble.
 It also ignores anything after the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{document}
\family default 
, on the assumption that it isn't LaTeX.
\layout Description

Pass\SpecialChar ~
1b \SpecialChar ~

Translate the preamble.
 Currently, that just means translating the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash

Once you know what class the document is, read the LyX layout file for that
 class.

\layout Description

Pass\SpecialChar ~

 This includes:

Change, e.g., 
\family typewriter 
x^2
\family default 
 to the equivalent but clearer 
\family typewriter

\family typewriter 

\backslash

Changing 
\family typewriter 
{
\backslash 
em foo}
\family default 
 to 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
emph{foo}
\family default

 This is necessary because LyX always writes out the non-local forms anyway.
 This should very rarely make a difference.

\layout Standard

If there are any 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
input
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
include
\family default 
 commands, reLyX will loop back to the beginning and translate those.
 It assumes that the included files are the same class as the main file,
 and that they have no preamble matter.
 (If you have an 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
input
\family default 
 command in the preamble of a file, the command will be copied exactly into
 the LaTeX preamble portion of the LyX file, so the included file won't
 be translated.) So when translating included files, it skips passes 0 and
 1.
\layout Standard

If reLyX doesn't find a file you wanted to include, it will give a warning,
 but will continue to translate any files it does find.
\layout Subsubsection

Layout Files
\layout Standard

reLyX reads a LyX layout file to know how to handle LaTeX environments and
 commands which get translated to LyX layouts.
 This file will include all 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 non-math environments (i.e., including quote and itemize, but not tabular,
 minipage, and some other fancy environments), and commands like 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
section
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
title
\family default 
.
 If you want to reLyX a class that doesn't have an existing layout file,
 then you'll have to create a layout file.
 But you have to do this anyway, in order to LyX the file, since LyX depends
 on layout files to know how to display and process its files.
 Check the LyX documentation for help with this task (which can be hard
 or easy, depending on the class you want to create a layout file for.) If
 your class is quite similar to a class that has a layout file, then consider
 using the 
\series bold 
-c
\series default 
 option.
\layout Subsubsection

Syntax Files
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sub:relyx-syntax}

\end_inset 


\layout Standard

reLyX always reads at least one syntax file, called the default syntax file.
 reLyX will read your personal syntax file if it exists; otherwise it will
 read the system-wide file.
 reLyX will read additional syntax files if you specify them with the 
\series bold 
-s
\series default 
 option.
 (These extra files should have the same format as the default file, but
 will tend to be shorter, since they only have to specify extra commands
 not found in the default file.) A syntax file tells reLyX a few things.
\layout Standard

First, it describes the syntax of each command, that is, how many required
 arguments and how many optional arguments the command takes.
 Knowing this makes it easier for reLyX to copy (in TeX mode) commands that
 it doesn't know how to translate.
 The syntax file simply has a command, followed by braces or brackets describing
 its arguments in the correct order.
 For example, a syntax file entry 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
bibitem[]{}
\family default 
 means that the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
bibitem
\family default 
 command takes an optional argument followed by a required one, while the
 entry 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
bf
\family default 
 means that the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
bf
\family default 
 command takes no arguments at all.
  When reLyX encounters a token that it doesn't know how to translate into
 LyX, it will copy the token---along with the correct number of arguments---exac
tly.
  If the token is not in the syntax file, then reLyX just copies as many
 arguments as it finds.
  This means that it may copy too much.
 But since the user can specify additional syntax files, that shouldn't
 happen often.
\layout Standard

Some commands that cannot be translated to LyX, like 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
mbox
\family default 
, have as one of their arguments regular LaTeX text.
 If the string 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

translate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is put into an argument of an (untranslatable) command in the syntax file,
 then reLyX will translate that argument instead of copying it verbatim.
 So, for example, the default syntax file has 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
raisebox{}[][]{translate}
\family default 
.
 This means that the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
raisebox
\family default 
 command and the first argument (and optional arguments if they exist) are
 copied in TeX mode, but the last argument (which may contain math, complicated
 LaTeX, other untranslatable commands, etc.) will be translated into LyX.
 You can't use 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

translate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 on optional arguments.
\layout Standard

User-defined syntax files are allowed to define new commands and their syntax,
 or override the number of arguments for a command given in the default
 syntax file.
 (E.g., if you're using a style that gives an extra argument to some command...)
 However, this will only be useful for commands copied in TeX mode.
 Commands which are actually translated by reLyX (like 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
item
\family default 
) have their argument syntax hard-coded.
 The hard-coded commands are identified in the default syntax file.
\layout Standard

Second, the syntax file describes any 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

regular environments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
  Usually, an entire unknown environment will be copied in TeX mode.
 If you define a regular environment 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

foo
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, though, then only the 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{foo}
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{foo}
\family default 
 commands will be copied in TeX mode; the text within the environment will
 be treated (i.e., translated) by reLyX as regular LaTeX, rather than being
 copied into TeX mode.
 Don't try to declare 
\family typewriter 
tabbing
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
picture
\family default 
 as regular environments, as the text within those environments will confuse
 reLyX; use this capability for new environments you create that have plain
 text or math or simple commands in them.
 You also can't declare unknown math environments (like 
\family typewriter 
equation*
\family default 
) as regular environments, either, since the LyX math editor won't understand
 them.
 The names of regular environments appear, whitespace-separated, between
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{reLyXre}
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{reLyXre}
\family default 
 statements in the syntax file.
 (If you have a regular environment which you won't use very often, you
 can use the 
\series bold 
-r
\series default 
 option rather than writing a syntax file.)
\layout Standard

Third, the syntax file describes a math translation table.
 The LyX math editor doesn't support a few commands.
 For example, 
\family typewriter 
_
\family default 
 is supported, but the equivalent 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
sb
\family default 
 is not.
 Put any commands you'd like translate between 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
begin{reLyXmt}
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
end{reLyXmt}
\family default 
 statements.
 The statement 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
| {
\backslash 
Vert}
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 means that any 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
|
\family default 
 in math mode will be converted to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
Vert
\family default 
 
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
 
\family default 
(in cases where a token made up of a backslash and a non-letter is translated
 to something with letters at the end, a space is added by reLyX.
 That way, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
|a
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is correctly translated to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
Vert a
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

).
\layout Subsubsection

Miscellaneous
\layout Standard

You need Perl version 5.002 or later to run reLyX.
 <plug> If you don't have Perl, you should get it anyway (at 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url[Perl]{http://www.perl.com/}

\end_inset 

), because it's a really useful tool for pretty much anything.
 </plug>
\layout Subsection

Diagnostics
\layout Standard

reLyX should always explain why it crashes, if it crashes.
 Some diagnostics may be very technical, though, if they come from the guts
 of the code.
 reLyX gives much more information while running if you use the 
\series bold 
-d
\series default 
 option, but you shouldn't need that unless something goes wrong.
\layout Standard

When it's finished, reLyX will tell you if it finished successfully or died
 due to some error.
\layout Subsection

Warnings
\layout Standard

Always keep a copy of your original LaTeX files either under a different
 name or in a different directory.
 There are a couple ways in which using LyX could lead to overwriting the
 original LaTeX file.
\layout Standard

If you import 
\family typewriter 
foo.tex
\family default 
 to create 
\family typewriter 
foo.lyx
\family default 
, then edit 
\family typewriter 
foo.lyx
\family default 
 and want to re-export it, note that it will overwrite the original 
\family typewriter 
foo.tex
\family default 
.
 (LyX will 
\emph on 
not
\emph default 
 ask you if you want to overwrite it.)
\layout Standard

If you have chosen not to use a temporary directory in the preferences,
 then LyX will create its temporary files in your current directory, which
 means your LaTeX original may be overwritten (without a warning from LyX)
 when you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

view dvi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 or print the LyX document.

LyX Features needing Extra Software
\layout Section

Using LyX with SGML-Tools (aka LinuxDoc)
\layout Standard

by 
\noun on 
Paul Evans
\layout Subsection

Overview
\layout Standard

LinuxDoc is a document class available in LyX if you have the 
\family typewriter 
sgml-tools
\family default 
 package installed.
 You can use it to produce documents in the so-called Standardized General
 Mark-up Language (SGML) in the particular format used by the Linux Documentatio
n Project.
 That is obviously helpful if you are contributing to that project.
 You can use the SGML format with the 
\family typewriter 
sgml-tools
\family default 
 package of scripts and programs (to produce other formats, including Latex,
 HTML, plain text, man pages and\SpecialChar \ldots{}
).
 You may therefore prefer to use this document class if you want to write
 something that can be easily translated into other formats.
\layout Standard

You will find that LinuxDoc has fewer layout options than the other text
 classes in LyX.
 This is mainly so that the translations into other formats have a chance
 of making some sense.
 In this section we describe:
\layout Itemize

how to setup and use a document in LinuxDoc
\layout Itemize

how to use the tags in LinuxDoc to layout your document
\layout Itemize

how to use the SGML packages to produce the various formats
\layout Itemize

how to sort out some problems.

Getting started
\layout Standard

D
\bar default 
ocument\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
S
\bar default 
ettings
\family default 
 dialog.

\family sans 
 
\family default 
Then you will find that there are fewer paragraph environments than for
 most other classes.
 You can see them on the pull down box on the left of the tool bar.
 How to use them is described in section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:sgmlparas}

\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

You 
\emph on 
must
\emph default 
 enter a title for the document, followed by an author, marking each with
 the appropriate paragraph environment.
 If you don't do this, you will get errors when you try to print the file.
 You can then enter the date and an abstract.
 The document proper must start with a Section paragraph environment rather
 than any standard layout.
\layout Standard

After that you can prepare a document as usual using the available range
 of paragraph environments.
 See section\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:sgmlparas}

\end_inset 

 for the full list and their uses.
\layout Subsubsection

Output from LinuxDoc
\layout Standard

You can print and save these documents in the normal way.
 To use the other features of the SGML package you need to save your document
 as LinuxDoc; this is a version in which the document is translated into
 the basic sgml tags.
 Use

\family default 
 You will get a file with the same name and a

 extension rather than a 
\family typewriter 
.lyx
\family default 
 extension.
 See\SpecialChar ~

The Structure of a LinuxDoc Document
\layout Standard

There is a formal structure for LinuxDoc which limits how you can place
 tags.
 There are two parts to all documents: 
\layout Description

Header: this is everything up to the first time you insert a Section layout
 marker.
 It can include title, author, date, abstract and ToC.
 You must include the first two.
\layout Description

Body: from the beginning of the first section onwards.
 All other tags are allowed.

Cross references and HTML 
\layout Standard

On the
\family sans 
 Insert
\family default 
 menu you will find two new options relating to the inclusion of URL addresses.
 If you use either option you will find some highlighted TeX code inserted
 into your document in three separate blocks with spaces available between.
 The blocks will be:
\layout Quote


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
htmlurl{
\family default 
 or 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
url{
\family roman 

\hfill 
space
\family default 
 
\family typewriter 

\hfill 
}{
\family roman 

\hfill 
space
\hfill 

\family typewriter 
}
\layout Standard

You insert a full HTML tag between the first and second blocks.
 This can be 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://any.address}

\end_inset 

 or other valid tags such as 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{mailto:me@my.address}

\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
.
\family default 
Then y
\family roman 
ou 
\family default 
insert some description between the second and third blocks.
 The differences are:

Troubleshooting LinuxDoc
\layout Standard

When you print or preview a LinuxDoc document some checking is done of the
 tags before LaTeX is run.
 Some errors are trapped here, especially those concerning the structure
 of the document.
 LyX may produce an error message, but not leave an error box in the document
 for you to open.
 You may have to look at the files directly to discover what is wrong.
 Most problems seem to come from the use of options that are not fully available
 in the text class.

Introduction

Under the

 This feature requires you to have the 
\family typewriter

 program installed, and is grayed out if you don't have it.
 You can get it from your nearest CTAN mirror, or over the Web from 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \url{http://www.ifi.uio.no/~jensthi/chktex/}

\end_inset

\layout Standard

The 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 package is a program that was written by 
\noun on 
Jens T.
 Berger Thielemann
\noun default 
 in frustration because some constructs in LaTeX are sometimes non-intuitive,
 and easy to forget.
 The program runs over your LaTeX file and checks the integrity of the file,
 and flags some common errors.
 In other technical words, it is 
\family typewriter 
Lint
\family default 
 for LaTeX.
\layout Standard

Well, what is a syntax checker doing in LyX which is supposed to produce
 correct LaTeX anyways? The answer is simple: Just as 
\family typewriter 
Lint
\family default 
 not only checks the 
\emph on 
syntax
\emph default 
 of C programs, but also does 
\emph on 
semantic
\emph default 
 checks for type-errors, 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 catches some common 
\emph on 
typographic
\emph default 
 errors, in addition to the syntactical ones.
 Specifically, 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 is capable of detecting several common errors, such as
\layout Itemize

Ellipsis detection:
\newline 
Use \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 instead of ...
\layout Itemize

No space in front of/after parenthesis:
\newline 
( wrong spacing )
\layout Itemize

Enforcement of normal space after common abbreviations:
\newline 
e.
 g.
 is too wide spacing.
\layout Itemize

Enforcement of end-of-sentence space when the last sentence ends with a
 capital letter:
\newline 
This is a TEST.
 And this is wrong spacing.
\layout Itemize

Space in front of labels and similar commands:
\newline 
The label should stick right up to the text to avoid falling to a wrong
 page.
 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:chktex}

\end_inset 

 
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

This footnote is in danger of falling off to a wrong page
\end_inset 

 The label is separated too much.
\layout Itemize

Space in front of references, instead of hard spaces:
\newline 
In you are in bad luck, the text will break right between the referenced
 text and reference number, and that's a pity.
 See section 
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:chktex}

\end_inset

\layout Itemize

Use of

 instead of

 between numbers:
\newline 
2x2 looks cheap compared to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

and more \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 It is an invaluable tool when you are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

finishing up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 your document before printing, and you should run it right after the obligatory
 spelling check, and before you go fine tuning the typesetting.
\layout Subsection

How to use it
\layout Standard

If you have the program installed, usage is as simple as choosing 
\family sans 
\bar under 
T
\bar default 
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
C
\bar default 
heck\SpecialChar ~
TeX
\family default 
.
 This will make LyX generate a LaTeX file of your document, start 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 to check it, and then make LyX insert 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

error boxes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 with the warnings from 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
, if there were any.
 The warnings will be placed close to the point of the mistake, and you
 can quickly find them by using the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
N
\bar default 
avigate\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
E
\bar default 
rror
\family default 
 menu item, or the shortcut key 
\family sans 
C-g
\family default 
 from the default 
\family typewriter 
cua
\family default 
 bind file.
 Open the error boxes by clicking on them with the mouse, or use the shortcut
 key 
\family sans 
C-i
\family default 
 from 
\family typewriter 
cua
\family default 
 bindings, or the corresponding 
\family sans 
C-o
\family default 
 for the alternate 
\family typewriter 
emacs
\family default 
 bind file.
 Read the warning and correct the mistake, if it is a mistake.
 If you have trouble understanding what the warning is about, you can safely
 ignore it.
 Remember that there is a hidden layer between the document on screen and
 the technical details in invoking 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
, and this gap can make some warnings seem arcane or just right down plain
 silly.
\layout Standard

This document is an excellent testing bed for the feature, and it should
 provide quite a few warnings for you to fiddle with.
 Since computers are only so smart, expect most of the warnings to be false
 alarms, though.
\layout Subsection

How to fine tune it
\layout Standard

Sometimes, you'll find that 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 makes more noise than suits your mood.
 Then you can choose not to use it, wait until your mood changes, or try
 to customize 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 to get better along with you.
 Another choice in the most desperate situations is to use 
\family sans 
\bar under 
V
\bar default 
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
R
\bar default 
emove\SpecialChar ~
All\SpecialChar ~
Error\SpecialChar ~
Boxes
\family default 
, which will get rid of all warnings instantly.
\layout Standard

Although 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 
\emph on 
is
\emph default 
 very configurable and extensible, you shouldn't expect to solve all problems
 with 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 in LyX this way.
 Since LyX has to generate a somewhat special LaTeX file to be able to match
 the line numbers from the 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 output
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

You can inspect the specific output from 
\family sans 
chktex
\family default 
 by using 
\family sans

View\SpecialChar ~
LaTeX\SpecialChar ~
Log
\family default 
 right after a 
\family sans 
chktex
\family default

\end_inset 

 to the internal document structure, some of the warnings will not seen
 to appear correctly.
 There are two things you can do about this:
\layout Itemize

Fine tune the 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 invocation command line in 
\family sans 
Preferences
\family default 
 (tabs 
\family sans 
Outputs
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Misc
\family default 
), or the global 
\family sans 
ChkTeX
\family default 
 installation configuration file (usually with the file 
\family typewriter 
/usr/local/share/chktexrc
\family default 
).
 See below to learn what warnings can be enabled and disabled on the command
 line.
 
\layout Itemize

Export your document as a raw LaTeX file using 
\family sans 
\bar under 
F
\bar default 
ile\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
E
\bar default 
xport\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
L
\bar default 
aTeX
\family default 
 and run 
\family typewriter 
chktex
\family default 
 manually on that.
 Invoked in this way, it can be a hassle to find the corresponding place
 in the document inside LyX, but with a little patience, you should be able
 to do it.
\layout Standard

Here follows the warning messages that can be enabled and disabled in 
\family sans 
Preferences
\family default 
.
 Use 
\family typewriter 
-n#
\family default 
 to disable a warning, and 
\family typewriter 
-w#
\family default 
 to enable a warning.
 The emphasized entries are disabled by default, because the default is
 "
\family typewriter 
chktex -n1 -n3 -n6 -n9 -n22 -n25 -n30 -n38
\family default 
".
\layout Standard

Notice that you should only use the options that enable and disable warnings,
 because LyX relies on some of the other command line parameters to be set
 in a specific way to have a chance to communicate with 
\family typewriter 
chktex
\family default 
.

Version Control in LyX
\layout Standard

by
\noun on 
 Lars Gullik Bjønnes
\layout Subsection

Introduction
\layout Standard

A friend of mine wanted to try LyX for a group project.
 When he didn't find support for version control or file locking, he dropped
 it.
 This angered me a bit, so I thought that I should at least make support
 for RCS (with the possibility of CVS and/or SCCS as a future improvement.)
 This has now been done.
 LyX now supports some of the most basic RCS commands.
 If you need to something a bit more sophisticated you will have to do that
 manually in an xterm.
\layout Standard

Before you begin to use the version control features in LyX, you should
 read 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

rcsintro
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (a man file, read it with 
\family typewriter 
man rcsintro
\family default 
).
 This file describes all the basic features of RCS.
 You should especially notice the comment about a RCS directory, and the
 notion of a master RCS file (the file ending in 
\family typewriter 
,v
\family default 
).
\layout Standard

The implementation in LyX assumes a recent version of the GNU RCS package---no
 guarantees are made for older versions.
\layout Subsection

The following sections describe the RCS commands supported by LyX.
 You can find them in the

 in the menu.
 And if it is under revision control, the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
R
\bar default 
egister
\family default 
 item is grayed out.
 
\layout Standard

This command registers your document with RCS\SpecialChar \@.
 You are asked interactively
 to supply an initial description of the document.
 The document is now set in Read-Only mode and you have to 
\family sans 
Check\SpecialChar ~
Out\SpecialChar ~

Edit
\family default 
, before making any changes to it.
 A document under revision control has a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\layout Standard

RCS command that is run:

\family sans 
Check In Changes
\layout Standard

When you are finished editing a file, you check in your changes.
 When you do this, you are asked for a description of the changes.
 This is stored in the history log.
 The version number is bumped, your changes are applied to the master RCS
 file, the document is unlocked and set to Read-Only mode.
 
\layout Standard

RCS command: 
\family typewriter 
ci -q -u -m"<description>" <file-name>
\layout Subsubsection


\family sans 
Check Out For Edit
\layout Standard

By doing this you lock the document so that only you can edit it.
 This will also make the document Read-Write only for you.
 You will usually continue editing for a while and when you are finished
 you check in your changes.
 The status line is changed to reflect that you have locked the file.
 
\layout Standard

RCS command: 
\family typewriter 
co -q -l <file-name>

\family sans 
Revert To Last Version

Literate Programming
\layout Standard

From the Literate Programming FAQ: 
\layout Quotation

Literate programming is the combination of documentation and source together
 in a fashion suited for reading by human beings.
 In fact, literate programs should be enjoyable reading, even inviting!
 (Sorry Bob, I couldn't resist!) In general, literate programs combine source
 and documentation in a single file.
 Literate programming tools then parse the file to produce either readable
 documentation or compilable source.
 The WEB style of literate programming was created by D.E.
 Knuth during the development of his TeX typesetting software.
 
\layout Standard

Another excerpt says:

\layout Itemize

It can generate the documentation either in latex or html.
\layout Itemize

It has a open architecture, i.e., it is easy to plug in new filters and to
 perform special processing that you may need.

LyX and Literate Programming
\layout Standard

The LyX support for Literate Programming is provided by using the generic
 LyX convertors mechanism.
 This support is provided in a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Noweb independent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 way, i.e., you will be able to use this new LyX feature with some other literate
 programming tool of your choice by just changing your LyX preferences.
\layout Subsubsection

Generating documents and code (weaving and tangling)
\layout Paragraph

Selecting the document class
\layout Standard

If you have installed Noweb and LyX successfully, whenever you open a new
 document or try to change the document class of an existing one, you will
 find that there are three new document classes available:
\layout Itemize

Article (Noweb)
\layout Itemize

Book (Noweb)
\layout Itemize

Report (Noweb)
\layout Standard

You must select one of them to create your literate documents from.
 
\layout Standard

Note that literate documents are not limited to these three classes.
 New classes can be generated from other styles like letter or in combination
 with other class variations like Article (AMS).
 If you have special needs that cannot be covered by one of the existing
 classes, let the LyX developers list (lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org) know and we
 will arrange to insert a new entry, or teach you how to do it.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

It is very simple, it involves the creation of a file with four lines, and
 re-running of the auto configuration.
\end_inset 

 Moreover, if you use a literate tool other than Noweb you may need to create
 a new set of document classes for it.
\layout Paragraph

Typing code in
\layout Standard

LyX enables you to write code with a layout named 
\noun on 
Scrap
\noun default 
.
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

The equivalent Noweb term is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Chunk
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 For historical reasons, I got used to the term 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

scrap
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 introduced by other literate tool named Nuweb, which I used for many years
 before rendering myself to Noweb.
\end_inset 

 Noweb delimits scraps like this:
\layout LyX-Code

<<My scrap>>=
\layout LyX-Code

  code
\layout LyX-Code

  more code
\layout LyX-Code

  even more code
\layout LyX-Code

  @
\layout Standard

The problem is that whatever is written in between the << and the 
\family typewriter 
@
\family default 
 must be taken literally, i.e., LyX should be prevented from making any special
 interpretation of what has been written.
 This is handled by a special layout named Scrap, that works like a normal
 paragraph but has a free spacing capability.
\layout Standard

The down side of the Scrap paragraph layout is that consecutive paragraphs
 of code will be spaced with one empty line in the source code and also
 in the printed documentation.
 The work around is to enter each line of code within a single Scrap, with
 a newline (ctrl-return).
 The example above will look like this:
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed true

\layout Standard

If you have a printed version of this document you will not see any difference
 between the previous example and this one.
\end_inset 


\layout LyX-Code

<<My scrap>>=
\newline 
  code
\newline 
  more code
\newline 
  even more code
\newline 
  @
\layout Standard

This layout works fine.
 The only real inconvenience is that you have to type ctrl-return instead
 of a plain return.
\begin_inset Foot

\layout Standard

It is in my list of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

improvements
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to fix that.
\end_inset 


\layout Standard

As a special note, you can also use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

%def
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 construct of Noweb in your scraps to add items to Noweb's identifier cross-refe
rence:
\layout LyX-Code

<<My scrap>>=
\newline 
  def some_function(args):
\newline 
    "This is the doc string for this function."
\newline 
    print "My args: ", args
\layout LyX-Code

@ %def some_function
\layout Standard

For an example of this usage and the resulting cross-reference output, look
 at the Literate python program in 
\emph on 
LIBDIR/examples/listerrors.lyx 
\emph default 
which should make this all clear.
\layout Paragraph

Generating the documentation
\layout Standard

At this point you already have a new document file with a proper document
 class, and with some code and text on it.
 How do I print it? The answer is simple, you select 
\family sans 
\bar under 
V
\bar default 
iew\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
D
\bar default 
VI,
\family default 
 etc.
 Just like you would do for a plain document.
 No special procedure is required.
\layout Standard

To help orientate you, I will now explain what happens inside LyX:
\layout Enumerate

When the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
U
\bar default 
pdate\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
D
\bar default 
VI 
\family default 
menu option is chosen, a latex file is generated.
 
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

If the document is of any literate class the generated file will be named
 with an extension name defined by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

literate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 format (defined in the Preferences panel), otherwise the file will have
 the usual 
\family typewriter 
.tex 
\family default 
extension.
\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Note that the only difference so far is in the name of the file, no special
 processing is required by LyX.
 Given that you formatted the code using the Scrap layout that, by itself,
 takes care of the business.
\layout Enumerate

If the document is of any literate class LyX will then use the internal
 LyX to Noweb converter, followed by the Noweb to LaTeX converter
\begin_inset Foot
collapsed false

\layout Standard

The converters are defined in the 
\family sans 
\bar under 
T
\bar default 
ools\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
P
\bar default 
references
\family default 
 panel, under the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Conversion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 tab.
\end_inset 

 to generate the LaTeX file.
\begin_deeper 
\layout Standard

Otherwise it will just skip this step.
\end_deeper 
\layout Enumerate

Finally, LaTeX is invoked and the regular post processing continues as in
 a plain document.
\layout Standard

Independence from a particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

literate tool
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 is easily achieved by changing the commands that are run by the various
 converters.
\layout Paragraph

Generating the code
\layout Standard

When the build menu option is chosen or the corresponding button in the
 toolbar is pressed, a latex file is generated just like step 1 above.
 Next, LyX invokes the
\family typewriter 
 Noweb->Program
\family default 
 converter.
 Typically, this converter (like any other converter), has two parts:
\layout Enumerate

The converter program itself.
 This program performs the conversion from the one format to the other (in
 this case, from the Noweb format to the Program pseudo-format).
\layout Enumerate

The error log parser.
 This is a program whose sole purpose is to rewrite error messages in a
 format that LyX understands.
 This makes it possible for LyX to place error boxes in the right places
 in the file buffer.
\layout Standard

The first part, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Converter
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 setting, should be set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
build-script $$i
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This basically means that LyX will call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 (a program or script) with the name of the Noweb file (generally a file
 in the LyX temp directory).
 
\layout Standard

This is an implementation of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 that you can place in a directory on your path:
\layout LyX-Code

#!/bin/sh
\layout LyX-Code

#
\layout LyX-Code

notangle -Rbuild-script $1 | env NOWEB_SOURCE=$1 sh
\layout Standard

The next part of the converter setting is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Flags
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 which is to be set to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
originaldir,parselog=listerrors
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 This will run any errors that are generated by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 process through the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

listerrors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 program.
\layout Standard

The converter code looks in 
\emph on 
MYLYXDIR/scripts 
\emph default 
first, then in
\emph on 
 LIBDIR/scripts 
\emph default 
then on the path for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

listerrors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 program.
\layout Paragraph

Build instructions in the document
\layout Standard

The last piece of the integration between LyX and noweb is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 scrap.
 Generally, the instructions for building your program should be embedded
 in a scrap of its own.
 The noweb-specific 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 above uses the notangle command to look for this scrap (called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

build-script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

) and runs its contents through 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

sh
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
\layout Standard

Typically, such a scrap would look something like this:
\layout LyX-Code

<<build-script>>=
\newline 
#!/bin/sh
\newline 

\newline 
if [ -z "${NOWEB_SOURCE}" ]
\newline 
then
\newline 
  NOWEB_SOURCE=myfile.nw
\newline 
fi
\newline 
[...
 code to extract files ...]
\newline 
[...
 code to compile files ...]
\newline 
@
\layout Standard

Look in 
\emph on 
LIBDIR/examples/listerrors.lyx 
\emph default 
or in 
\emph on 
LIBDIR/examples/Literate.lyx
\emph default 
 which implement two versions of the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

listerrors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 program for some illustrations of how all of these pieces go together or
 in 
\emph on 
LIBDIR/examples/noweb2lyx.lyx.
 
\emph default 
Interestingly, these three files show off the language-indepence of the
 LyX literate programming support since they are written in Python, C and
 Perl respectively.

\layout Subsubsection

Debug extensions
\layout Standard

There is also a new function implemented in the LyX server, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

server-goto-file-row" function, to be used with ddd/gdb or other debugger.
 
\layout Standard

When debugging code with ddd/gdb, it is possible to invoke a text editor
 at the current execution position with a single key stroke.
 The default ddd configuration for that is shift-ctrl-V.
 It happens that you can define the editor command line invocation in ddd
 by accessing the
\family sans 
 
\bar under 
E
\bar default 
dit\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under 
P
\bar default 
references\SpecialChar \menuseparator

\bar under

elpers 
\family default 
dialog and changing the "Edit Sources" entry.
\layout Standard

I take advantage of the new created LyX server function and this ddd feature,
 and set 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

Edit Sources
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 to:
\layout LyX-Code

echo "LYXCMD:monitor:server-goto-file-row:@FILE@ @LINE@" >~/.lyxpipe.in
\layout Standard

With this, whenever you are using ddd and find a point in the program that
 you want to edit, you just press shift-ctrl-V (in the ddd window), and
 ddd you forward this information to LyX through the LyX server and then
 the LyX window will show the same file with the cursor at the same position
 ddd was pointing to.
 No more guessing or long scrolling to locate a point in the program back
 from debugging !
\layout Standard

Note however that you must enable the LyX server to get this feature working
 (it is disabled by default).
 You can enable it in 
\family sans 
Preferences
\family default 
 (tabs 
\family sans 
Inputs
\family default

Colors customization
\layout Standard

There are a number of colors in LyX that can be customized in 
\family sans 
Preferences
\family default 
.
 One of the things that bothers people is the LaTeX font color.
 The default color is red, since the scraps uses LaTeX font, and there is
 a lot of scraps in literate documents, you may get tired of seeing everything
 in red.
 You can change it by going to the tabs 
\family sans 
Look&Feel
\family default 
, 
\family sans 
Colors.
\layout Standard

The next thing is the visible presence of the newline character in the screen.
 You can choose the color of this particular character and make it blend
 in the background.
 I recommend you choosing a color that is close to the background but not
 equal, that way you still can see it is there, but it is not bothering
 you anymore.

Limitations 
\layout Standard

The 
\family typewriter 
multicol
\family default 
 package allows switching between one and multicolumn format on the same
 page.
 Footnotes are handled correctly (for the most part), but will be placed
 at the bottom of the page and not under each column.
 LaTeX's float mechanism, however, is partly disabled in the current implementat
ion.
 At the moment only page-wide floats can be used within the scope of the
 environment.

The Adventure of the Empty House

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

\size small 
It was in the spring of the year 1894 that all London was interested, and
 the fashionable world dismayed, by the murder of the Honourable Ronald
 Adair under most unusual and inexplicable circumstances.
 The public has already learned those particulars of the crime which came
 out in the police investigation, but a good deal was suppressed upon that
 occasion, since the case for the prosecution was so overwhelmingly strong
 that it was not necessary to bring forward all the facts.
 Only now, at the end of nearly ten years, am I allowed to supply those
 missing links which make up the whole of that remarkable chain.
 The crime was of interest in itself, but that interest was as nothing to
 me compared to the inconceivable sequel, which afforded me the greatest
 shock and surprise of any event in my adventurous life.
 Even now, after this long interval, I find myself thrilling as I think
 of it, and feeling once more that sudden flood of joy, amazement, and increduli
ty which utterly submerged my mind.
 Let me say to that public, which has shown some interest in those glimpses
 which I have occasionally given them of the thoughts and actions of a very
 remarkable man, that they are not to blame me if I have not shared my knowledge
 with them, for I should have considered it my first duty to do so, had
 I not been barred by a positive prohibition from his own lips, which was
 only withdrawn upon the third of last month.

It can be imagined that my close intimacy with Sherlock Holmes had interested
 me deeply in crime, and that after his disappearance I never failed to
 read with care the various problems which came before the public.
 And I even attempted, more than once, for my own private satisfaction,
 to employ his methods in their solution, though with indifferent success.
 There was none, however, which appealed to me like this tragedy of Ronald
 Adair.
 As I read the evidence at the inquest, which led up to a verdict of willful
 murder against some person or persons unknown, I realized more clearly
 than I had ever done the loss which the community had sustained by the
 death of Sherlock Holmes.
 There were points about this strange business which would, I was sure,
 have specially appealed to him, and the efforts of the police would have
 been supplemented, or more probably anticipated, by the trained observation
 and the alert mind of the first criminal agent in Europe.
 All day, as I drove upon my round, I turned over the case in my mind and
 found no explanation which appeared to me to be adequate.
 At the risk of telling a twice-told tale, I will recapitulate the facts
 as they were known to the public at the conclusion of the inquest.

The Honourable Ronald Adair was the second son of the Earl of Maynooth,
 at that time governor of one of the Australian colonies.
 Adair's mother had returned from Australia to undergo the operation for
 cataract, and she, her son Ronald, and her daughter Hilda were living together
 at 427 Park Lane.

The youth moved in the best society--had, so far as was known, no enemies
 and no particular vices.
 He had been engaged to Miss Edith Woodley, of Carstairs, but the engagement
 had been broken off by mutual consent some months before, and there was
 no sign that it had left any very profound feeling behind it.
 For the rest {sic} the man's life moved in a narrow and conventional circle,
 for his habits were quiet and his nature unemotional.
 Yet it was upon this easy-going young aristocrat that death came, in most
 strange and unexpected form, between the hours of ten and eleven-twenty
 on the night of March 30, 1894.

Ronald Adair was fond of cards--playing continually, but never for such
 stakes as would hurt him.
 He was a member of the Baldwin, the Cavendish, and the Bagatelle card clubs.
 It was shown that, after dinner on the day of his death, he had played
 a rubber of whist at the latter club.
 He had also played there in the afternoon.

\size default 
 
\size footnotesize 
The evidence of those who had played with him-- Mr.
 Murray, Sir John Hardy, and Colonel Moran--showed that the game was whist,
 and that there was a fairly equal fall of the cards.
 Adair might have lost five pounds, but not more.
 His fortune was a considerable one, and such a loss could not in any way
 affect him.
 He had played nearly every day at one club or other, but he was a cautious
 player, and usually rose a winner.
 It came out in evidence that, in partnership with Colonel Moran, he had
 actually won as much as four hundred and twenty pounds in a sitting, some
 weeks before, from Godfrey Milner and Lord Balmoral.
 So much for his recent history as it came out at the inquest.

Numbering in Enumerate
\end_inset 


\layout Standard
\added_space_bottom bigskip 
by 
\noun on 
John Weiss
\layout Standard
\noindent 
The default numbering for the 
\family sans 
Enumerate
\family default 
 paragraph environment begins with Arabic numbers and ends with uppercase
 letters.
 Suppose, however, you wanted a different type of numbering scheme.
 Here's a quickie example of how to change the numbering scheme:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumi}{
\backslash 
Roman{enumi}.}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumii}{
\backslash 
Alph{enumii}.}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumiii}{
\backslash 
arabic{enumiii}.}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumiv}{
\backslash 
alph{enumiv}.)}
\layout Standard

\SpecialChar \ldots{}
 which changes the numbering scheme to uppercase Roman numerals, uppercase
 letters, Arabic numbers, and lowercase letter.
\layout Standard

Additionally, the previous example also adds a little bit extra to the numbering
 scheme.
 For example, the first level label actually looks like: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

I.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

.
 For ease of reading, we'll describe what the numbering schemes look like
 using a notation something like this: <
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

I.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

,\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

A.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

,\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

1.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

,\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

a.)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

>.
 
\layout Standard

As you can see in the example, there is a label command for each nesting
 level, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
labelenumi
\family default 
 \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
labelenumiv
\family default 
, as well as a counter, 
\family typewriter 
enumi
\family default 
 \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 
\family typewriter 
enumiv
\family default 
.
 There are also five 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

number printing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 commands, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
arabic{}
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
roman{}
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
Roman{}
\family default 
, 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
alph{}
\family default 
, and 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
Alph{}
\family default 
, each of which take one counter as an argument.
 You can add characters before or after these, but there's no need to add
 spaces.
\layout Standard

You can get really fancy with these.
 For example:
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumi}{
\backslash 
#
\backslash 
Alph{enumi}
\backslash 
#}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumii}{
\backslash 
Alph{enumi}.
\backslash 
arabic{enumii}}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumiii}{
\backslash 
alph{enumiii}+}
\layout LyX-Code


\backslash 
renewcommand{
\backslash 
labelenumiv}{(
\backslash 
roman{enumiv})}
\layout Standard

produces the somewhat out of hand numbering scheme: <
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 

#A#
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

,\SpecialChar ~

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

A.1

Extra Space Between Table Rows
\layout Standard
\added_space_bottom bigskip 
by 
\noun on 
Mike Ressler
\layout Standard
\noindent 
LaTeX allows you to put a bit of extra space between rows in a table by
 giving an optional argument to the end-of-row specifier (
\family typewriter 

\backslash 

\backslash 

\family default 
).
 LyX has not yet implemented this in a formal way, so here are two dirty
 little tricks to do the same job.
 
\layout Standard

The first is the more formal, but longwinded way to do it.
 In the LaTeX preamble, add the following command definition: 
\layout Standard


\family typewriter 

\backslash 
newcommand{
\backslash 
extratablespace}[1]{
\backslash 
noalign{vskip#1}}
\family default 
 This command takes a single argument---the amount of space you would like
 to insert.
 Insert the command in the first column of the row 
\emph on 
after
\emph default 
 where you would like the space to appear.
 Here is an example (I've removed all the borders using 
\family sans 
\bar under 
L
\bar default 
ayout\SpecialChar \menuseparator
Tabl
\bar under

The second method is faster, but will make typographers and TeXperts all
 over the world groan.
 Simply put an end of row specifier with optional argument at the same spot.
 No fancy definitions are needed as in the above example, but there will
 be more space inserted than you specified because you essentially added
 a blank row plus the extra space.
 If the space added is too much, simply use a negative number, like so:

 The

dropcaps
\family default

 delete the

\family typewriter

 and the pluses from the TeX code at the beginning of the paragraph, and
 add

 to your LaTeX preamble, you will get a nice Times Roman Italic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (Make certain you have copied 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
dropcaps.sty
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

 into a directory where TeX can see it.) The first argument is the amount
 of indentation; in this case the negative sign moves it into the margin.
 The second argument is the height of the letter in number of lines of text.
 The third argument is the font name: virtually anything which has a tfm
 file should work (wade through the 
\family typewriter 
.../texmf/fonts/tfm
\family default 
 directory for possibilities).
 My personal favorite is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset 


\family typewriter 
yinit
\family default 

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset 

, a fancy German font specifically designed for dropped capitals.
 The fourth argument is the letter (or letters) to be dropped.
 The

There are times when the tyranny of rectangular paragraphs must be overthrown.
 In such situations, a call to the delightful plain TeX command 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
parshape
\family default 
 is called for.
 As you can see, completely arbitrary shapes can be laid out with a suitable
 set of linelength definitions.
 While this parshape may look a bit silly and useless, one could conceive
 of situations such as finely tuned dropped capitals, word wrapping around
 non-rectangular graphics, etc.
 which will benefit from such handcrafting.
\layout Standard
\added_space_top bigskip 
The syntax is 
\family typewriter 

\backslash 
parshape numlines #1indent #1length #2indent #2length \SpecialChar \ldots{}
 #nindent #nlength
\family default 
, where 
\family typewriter 
numlines
\family default 
 is the number of lines of text which define the paragraph.
 If there turn out to be fewer lines, the shape is truncated; if there are
 more, the excess lines have the same dimensions as the last line of the
 definition.
 The 
\family typewriter 
#nindent
\family default 
 and 
\family typewriter 
#nlength
\family default 
 entries specify the indentation of the line from the left margin, and the
 length of the line as measured from that point.
 The shape applies only to the current paragraph; everything is reset to
 normal for the next paragraph.

As you can see, the examples in this section range from the useful to the
 whimsical.
 While I don't expect that anyone will ever need the paragraph shape demonstrate
d in the last section, the important point is that you can do almost anything
 you want in LyX if you are willing to figure out how to do it in TeX and
 LaTeX.
 TeX is a fantastically powerful typesetting system and all that power is
 available to you since LyX uses it as its backend.
 Happy LyXing!
