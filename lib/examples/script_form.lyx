 dialogindent will automatically change the position of parentheticals and

\begin_layout General
You can put your Speaker names in labels, the insert cross references to
 the labels.
 The printed version will automatically be capitalized in Speaker even if
 the label is not capped.
 This way you can use them in dialogue also, and change all references to
 your Speaker's names just by changing the label.

Use the description after INT.

 to keep it on the same page.
 Narrative is the same, except that it allows a pagebreak before it.
 Notice that I did not use the labels for Joe and April here because they
 are upper-cased in discriptions only the first time they are used.
 You could make extra labels, but I think it would be error-prone.

 Rules for breaking a page.
 Scene headers, like INT., remain attached to Description.
 If a page breaks between a Speaker and a one sentence Dialogue, move it

Number each and every page, though you can start with page two.
 The numbers should appear in the upper right hand corner, about 0.5 inches
 down and 0.75 inches from the right page edge.
 Those dimensions are not set in stone, but page numbers should always be
 placed in the upper right hand corner.

Oftentimes for narration, for a narrator's voice.

 Documentary films are filled with voice over.

By the way, the first time you introduce a speaker in description, you CAP

 And when you break dialogue with description, the standard is to place
 "continuing" within parentheses when a speaker chatters on and on.

You need your script, two sheets of plain manila binding stock, a three

 When you get it all assembled, you can hammer the brass brads down to make
 it good and tight.
