 Basic Philosophy

\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic philosophy of LyX is that you should worry about the content of
 what you're writing and not the form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.1 How LyX does it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX uses LaTeX, a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport
 in 1985.
 It, in turn, was built up from a typesetting language called TeX, created
 by Donald Knuth in 1984.
 LaTeX is designed around a philosophy similar to that of LyX.
 Leslie Lamport once said (see reference [1])

"hard-coded".

The function of typographic design is to help the reader understand the
 author's ideas.
 For a document to be easy to read, its visual structure must reflect its
 logical structure.
 Quotations and computer programs, being logically distinct structural elements,
 should be distinguished visually from one another....
 Since LaTeX can't understand your prose, you must explicitly indicate the
 logical structure by typing special commands....
 As you are writing your document, you should be concerned with its logical
 structure, not its visual appearance.

1.2 Why LyX is better
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX can be useful to more people than LaTeX.
 It's considerably easier to learn, because you don't need to learn LaTeX
 (which is practically a programming language).
 LyX is basically like other

What you see is what you get

 word processors, except that LyX is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you see is what you mean

\end_inset

.
 In this way, it combines the ease of use of word processors with the power
 of LaTeX.
 This is a Good Thing.
 Also, the file format is platform independent.
 Best of all, it's FREE!

 Features of LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has many features which make writing documents easier.
 (After all, why else would you want to use it?

\begin_layout Plain Layout

 to talk about them.
 Here's a list of just a few.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* LyX worries about margins, and footnote numbering for you
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* LyX makes it simple to write and edit mathematical formulae
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a more philosophical discussion of why LyX is better than lots of other
 word processors, see Section 1.2, which can be found on page 1.

 Math Stuff

\begin_layout Standard
My favorite equation is the solution to a quadratic equation.
 If ax^2+bx+c=0 (eq.1), then x= -b + or minus the square root of b^2-4ac
 all divided by 2a (eq.
 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another favorite equation is the basis of calculus: f'(x) is defined as
 the limit as deltax goes to zero of f(x+deltax) - f(x) divided by deltax
 (eq.
 3).
