 Basic Philosophy

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic philosophy of \SpecialChar LyX
 is that you should worry about the content of what
 you're writing and not the form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.1 How \SpecialChar LyX
 does it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 uses \SpecialChar LaTeX
, a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport in 1985.
 It, in turn, was built up from a typesetting language called \SpecialChar TeX
, created
 by Donald Knuth in 1984.
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is designed around a philosophy similar to that of \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Leslie Lamport once said (see reference [1])
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hint: Probably, this CITATION REFERENCE shouldn't be

"hard-coded".
 What if we make Lamport's book the second

The function of typographic design is to help the reader understand the
 author's ideas.
 For a document to be easy to read, its visual structure must reflect its
 logical structure.
 Quotations and computer programs, being logically distinct structural elements,
 should be distinguished visually from one another....
 Since \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can't understand your prose, you must explicitly indicate the logical
 structure by typing special commands....
 As you are writing your document, you should be concerned with its logical
 structure, not its visual appearance.

1.2 Why \SpecialChar LyX
 is better
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 can be useful to more people than \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 It's considerably easier to learn, because you don't need to learn \SpecialChar LaTeX
 (which
 is practically a programming language).
 \SpecialChar LyX
 is basically like other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

What you see is what you get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word processors, except that \SpecialChar LyX
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you see is what you mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this way, it combines the ease of use of word processors with the power
 of \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 This is a Good Thing.
 Also, the file format is platform independent.
 Best of all, it's FREE!

 Features of \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 has many features which make writing documents easier.
 (After all, why else would you want to use it?

\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Hint: Emphasize!
\end_layout

 to talk about them.
 Here's a list of just a few.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* \SpecialChar LyX
 worries about margins, and footnote numbering for you
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
* \SpecialChar LyX
 makes it simple to write and edit mathematical formulae
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a more philosophical discussion of why \SpecialChar LyX
 is better than lots of other
 word processors, see Section 1.2, which can be found on page 1.

\begin_layout Standard
My favorite equation is the solution to a quadratic equation.
 If ax^2+bx+c=0 (eq.1), then x= -b + or minus the square root of b^2-4ac
 all divided by 2a (eq.
 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another favorite equation is the basis of calculus: f'(x) is defined as
 the limit as deltax goes to zero of f(x+deltax) - f(x) divided by deltax
 (eq.
 3).
