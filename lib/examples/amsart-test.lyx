\begin_layout Thanks
To Emmanuel, for forcing me to fix this, and Jean-Marc, for making it possible,
 and necessary.
 Also to Mate, who suggested numerous improvements.

\begin_layout Abstract
This is not very abstract.
 Note that the abstract must be part of the title stuff for AMS.
 LyX is aware of that since version 0.12.1.
 Good.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
This file, and any amsart-* LyX file, can be converted to either of the
 numbering schemes by simply changing the document class in the 
\family sans

 The styles are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
amsart - The standard AMS-article format.
 All results and similar statements are numbered as 
\begin_inset Formula $(n.m)$
\end_inset

, where the first number refers to the section, and the second refers to
 the total number of results (Theorems, Corollaries, Propositions, Definitions
 and Remarks, etc.) in that section.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
 Unnumbered environments indicated by an asterisk at the end.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
amsart-seq - Here, numbering for each type of statement is in its own sequence,
 with no reference to the section number.
 There are also many (but not all) environments available unnumbered, which
 is occasionally needed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
This is a numbered theorem

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More text.
 Note that two occurrences of the same environment, like two definitions,
 need to be separated somehow.
 For the moment, the best way is to include a paragraph with a %, in the
 LaTeX environment, if you really want two definitions (or whatever) together,
 with no intervening text of another sort.

 that doesn't require numbered results.
