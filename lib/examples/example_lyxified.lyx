\begin_layout Title
THIS IS THE TITLE OF THE DOCUMENT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic Philosophy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic philosophy of LyX is that you should worry about the content of
 what you're writing and not the form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How LyX does it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX uses LaTeX, a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport
 in 1985.
 It, in turn, was built up from a typesetting language called TeX, created
 by Donald Knuth in 1984.
 LaTeX is designed around a philosophy similar to that of LyX.
 Leslie Lamport once said (see reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lamport"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The function of typographic design is to help the reader understand the
 author's ideas.
 For a document to be easy to read, its visual structure must reflect its
 logical structure.
 Quotations and computer programs, being logically distinct structural elements,
 should be distinguished visually from one another....
 Since LaTeX can't understand your prose, you must explicitly indicate the
 logical structure by typing special commands....
 As you are writing your document, you should be concerned with its logical
 structure, not its visual appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why LyX is better
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset

LyX can be useful to more people than LaTeX.
 It's considerably easier to learn, because you don't need to learn LaTeX
 (which is practically a programming language).
 LyX is basically like other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you see is what you get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word processors, except that LyX is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you see is what you mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this way, it combines the ease of use of word processors with the power
 of LaTeX.
 This is a Good Thing.
 Also, the file format is platform independent.
 Best of all, it's FREE!

\begin_layout Section
Features of LyX
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX has many features which make writing documents easier.

After all, why else would you want to use it?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I'm

very excited

 to talk about them.
 Here's a list of just a few.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX worries about margins, and footnote numbering for you
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
LyX makes it simple to write and edit mathematical formulae
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a more philosophical discussion of why LyX is better than lots of other
 word processors, see Section

Lame attempts to use other LyX stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wrote a program the other day.
 It looked like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_inset Quotes eld

I'M AWESOME!

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
After all that scientific thinking, I started feeling more artistic, so
 I wrote this haiku

 It saves so much time

\begin_layout Section
Math Stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My favorite equation is the solution to a quadratic equation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$
\end_inset

 (eq.1), then 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$
\end_inset

 (eq.
 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another favorite equation is the basis of calculus: 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(x)\equiv\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

 (eq.
 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple notes about LyXifiying this file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I was able to remove the lines made with dashes.
 They were there purely to separate the title and references from the rest
 of the document.
 LyX (LaTeX) knows enough to separate these parts of the document with space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I didn't bother putting the math equations in display mode.
 Also, I didn't use LyX' automatic equation numbering, because it's not
 described in the

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I didn't have to type the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

References

 below.
 LyX automatically writes it (or the word
