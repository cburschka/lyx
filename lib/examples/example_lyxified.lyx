\begin_layout Title
THIS IS THE TITLE OF THE DOCUMENT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
by Fee \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Basic Philosophy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The basic philosophy of \SpecialChar LyX
 is that you should worry about the content of what
 you're writing and not the form.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
How \SpecialChar LyX
 does it
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 uses \SpecialChar LaTeX
, a document preparation system designed by Leslie Lamport in 1985.
 It, in turn, was built up from a typesetting language called \SpecialChar TeX
, created
 by Donald Knuth in 1984.
 \SpecialChar LaTeX
 is designed around a philosophy similar to that of \SpecialChar LyX
.
 Leslie Lamport once said (see reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lamport"
literal "true"

\end_inset

):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
The function of typographic design is to help the reader understand the
 author's ideas.
 For a document to be easy to read, its visual structure must reflect its
 logical structure.
 Quotations and computer programs, being logically distinct structural elements,
 should be distinguished visually from one another....
 Since \SpecialChar LaTeX
 can't understand your prose, you must explicitly indicate the logical
 structure by typing special commands....
 As you are writing your document, you should be concerned with its logical
 structure, not its visual appearance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Why \SpecialChar LyX
 is better
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Why-LyX-is"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 can be useful to more people than \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 It's considerably easier to learn, because you don't need to learn \SpecialChar LaTeX
 (which
 is practically a programming language).
 \SpecialChar LyX
 is basically like other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you see is what you get
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 word processors, except that \SpecialChar LyX
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What you see is what you mean
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In this way, it combines the ease of use of word processors with the power
 of \SpecialChar LaTeX
.
 This is a Good Thing.
 Also, the file format is platform independent.
 Best of all, it's FREE!

\begin_layout Section
Features of \SpecialChar LyX

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar LyX
 has many features which make writing documents easier.

After all, why else would you want to use it?
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I'm

very excited

 to talk about them.
 Here's a list of just a few.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LyX
 worries about margins, and footnote numbering for you
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\SpecialChar LyX
 makes it simple to write and edit mathematical formulae

 is better than lots of other
 word processors, see Section

Lame attempts to use other \SpecialChar LyX
 stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I wrote a program the other day.
 It looked like this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code

After all that scientific thinking, I started feeling more artistic, so
 I wrote this haiku

\begin_layout Verse
\SpecialChar LyX
 is really great 
\begin_inset Newline newline

Typesetting word processor
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

 It saves so much time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Math Stuff
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My favorite equation is the solution to a quadratic equation.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $ax^{2}+bx+c=0$
\end_inset

 (eq.1), then 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}$
\end_inset

 (eq.
 2).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another favorite equation is the basis of calculus: 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(x)\equiv\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow0}\frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$
\end_inset

 (eq.
 3).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A couple notes about \SpecialChar LyX
ifiying this file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I was able to remove the lines made with dashes.
 They were there purely to separate the title and references from the rest
 of the document.
 \SpecialChar LyX
 (\SpecialChar LaTeX
) knows enough to separate these parts of the document with space.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I didn't bother putting the math equations in display mode.
 Also, I didn't use \SpecialChar LyX
' automatic equation numbering, because it's not described
 in the 
\emph on
Tutorial

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I didn't have to type the word

 \SpecialChar LyX
 automatically writes it (or the word
