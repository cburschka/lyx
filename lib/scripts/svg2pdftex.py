# This script converts an SVG image to something that pdflatex can process
# into high quality PDF.

# Usage:
#   python svg2pdftex.py ${base}.svg ${base}.pdft
# This command generates
#   ${base}.pdf  the converted pdf file
#   ${base}.pdft a tex file that can be included in your latex document
#       using '\input{${base}.pdft}'
#
# Note:
#   Do not use this command as
#     python svg2pdftex.py file.svg file.pdf
#   the real pdf file will be overwritten by a tex file named file.pdf.
