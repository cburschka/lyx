# This script converts an XFIG image to something that latex can process
# into high quality PostScript.

# Usage:
#   python fig2pstex.py ${base}.fig ${base}.pstex
# This command generates
#   ${base}.eps    the converted eps file
#   ${base}.pstex  a tex file that can be included in your latex document
#       using '\input{${output}}'.
#
# Note:
#   Do not use this command as
#     python fig2pstex.py file.fig file.eps
#   the real eps file will be overwritten by a tex file named file.eps.
