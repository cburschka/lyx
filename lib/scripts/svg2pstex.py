# This script converts an SVG image to two files that can be processed
# with latex into high quality DVI/PostScript. It requires Inkscape.

# Usage:
#   python svg2pstex.py [inkscape_command] inputfile.svg outputfile.eps_tex
# This command generates
#   1. outputfile.eps     -- the converted EPS file (text from SVG stripped)
#   2. outputfile.eps_tex -- a TeX file that can be included in your
#                             LaTeX document using '\input{outputfile.eps_text}'
#
# Note:
#   Do not use this command as
#     python svg2pstex.py [inkscape_command] inputfile.svg outputfile.pdf
#   the real EPS file would be overwritten by a TeX file named outputfile.eps.
#

# This script converts an SVG image to something that latex can process
# into high quality PostScript.
