# FIXME: Have a look at the encodings known by the inputenc package and add
# missing ones. Caution: File format change!

# Note that you can only add singlebyte encodings to this file.
# LyX does not support the output of multibyte encodings (e.g. utf16).
# It does support singlebyte encodings with variable width (e.g. utf8).
# These are marked with the "variable" keyword.
# Fixed width encodings are marked with the "fixed" keyword.
# The code points of TeX control characters like {, } and \ can occur in the
# second byte of some variable width encodings. These encodings must not be
# set as document encodings and are marked with the "variableunsafe" keyword.
# They are only needed for proper tex2lyx import.

# Most encodings require loading a latex package such as "inputenc" or "CJK".
# There is no "japanese" latex package, rather this keyword indicates to LyX
# to switch the buffer format and use platex instead of standard (pdf)latex.
# In this case, TeX control characters in high bytes is not a problem.
# The invocation is platex -kanji=<LaTeX name>

# The set of "iconv" supported encodings is system dependent.

# For Gnu libiconv, supported encodings are listed at
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/
# and available via the `iconv --list` command.

# Syntax: Encoding <LyX name> <LaTeX name> <GUI name> <iconv name> <width> <package> End

# LyX name:    Name used by the file format and in lib/languages. Must be unique!
# LaTeX name:  Used in the latex export or passed to platex as command-line switch.
# GUI name:    Displayed in document settings.
# iconv name:  Used by iconv.
# width:       One of fixed, variable, or variableunsafe (see above).
# package:     One of none, inputenc, CJK, or japanese (see above).

# Encodings used with inputenc.sty
# ================================

# "inputenc" is a base LaTeX package that provides an extensible framework
# for conversion of a document encoding into an "LaTeX Internal Character
# Representation" (LICR) and a set of encoding definitions
# (<LaTeX name>.def files). Additional encoding definitions are provided by
# several language support packages.
#
# The following encodings from http://www.ctan.org/pkg/latex-cyrillic are
# not included, because they are not widely used and lack iconv support:
# ctt, dbk, isoir111, koi8-ru, lcyenc, maccyr, macukr, mik, mls, mnk, mos,
# and pt254.

# inputenc's standard utf8 support:

# This one is used by many CJK packages. utf8 is supposed to be the successor,
# but does not have all features of utf8x yet.
