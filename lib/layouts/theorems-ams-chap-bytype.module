#\DeclareLyXModule{Theorems (AMS, Numbered by Type within Chapters)}
#DescriptionBegin
#Defines theorem environments and the proof environment using the extended
#AMS machinery. Both numbered and unnumbered types are provided. Contrary to the
#plain AMS Theorem module, the different theorem types provided here each have
#a separate counter (e.g., theorem 1.1, theorem 1.2, lemma 1.1, proposition 1.1,
#theorem 1.3, lemma 1.2, ..., as opposed to theorem 1, theorem 2, lemma 3,
#proposition 4, ...). The numbering restarts for each chapter: theorem 1.1,
#theorem 2.1, ...
#DescriptionEnd
#Excludes: theorems-std | theorems-starred | theorems-ams | theorems-bytype

Requires	amsmath,amsthm

# The environments defined (regular and starred) are :
# - theorem
# - corollary
# - lemma
# - proposition
# - conjecture
# - fact
# - definition
# - example
# - solution
# - problem
# - exercise
# - remark
# - claim

# We need separate counters for each theorem-like style.
