# Version 0.0   5/27/99  - Initial submission, basic LaTeX equivalents
# Version 0.1   6/04/99  - Most everything in sections 2.1-2.11 of AASTeX guide
#                          works. References work with some ERT. Regular tables
#                          (2.14) okay, deluxetable will never be supported.
#                          Figures (2.13) not even attempted yet. Misc (2.15)
#                          partially supported, but much will remain ERT.
#                          Style options (section 3) can be typed into Extra
#                          Document options.
#                          Much cleaning of this file needs to be done.
# Version 1.0   6/09/99  - Implemented remaining commands as well as possible.
#                          There is little more I can do unless LyX source code
#                          is changed. (Not by me!) Documentation, template, and
#                          example files are available.
# Version 1.1   7/25/99  - Changed \url to take advantage of new layout option.
# Version 1.2   4/18/02  - Updated for natbib in 1.2.0
# Version 1.3   5/7/04   - Updated for AASTeX 5.2
# Version 1.4   26/10/08 - new custom insets for \altaffilmark, \tablenotemark
#                        - new environments for \altaffiltext and \tablenotetext
# Version 1.5   26/11/12 - added mandatory argument for \altaffiltext
# Version 1.6   23/01/15 - fix for the optional argument of \figcaption
#
# Version 6.0   31/03/16 - Stub for AASTeX 6.0:
#  	  		   new layout file aastex6.layout, because
#  	  		   aastex.cls was renamed to aastex6.cls (2016/02/16)
#			   (cf. LyX ticket #10027)
#
# TODO: - support for new commands (see below)
#       - aastex6.cls loads hyperref (with pre-set options) and url
#         -> option clash if "Use Hyerref" is selected in Document>Settings

Format 65
