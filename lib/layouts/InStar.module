#\DeclareLyXModule{Title and Preamble Hacks}
#DescriptionBegin
#Provides two new styles:
#1. An 'In Preamble' style that puts whatever is entered into it into the preamble.
#   This can be used, if one wishes, to include preamble code in the body of the
#   LyX document.
#2. An 'In Title' style that will put its contents into the body of the LaTeX 
#   document, but before \maketitle is issued. This is useful for making branches
#   and notes in title-related material. (If you put these in a Standard layout,
#   this signals to LyX to output \maketitle, which may then come too early.)
