#\DeclareLyXModule{Theorems (AMS, Numbered by Type)}
#DescriptionBegin
#Defines theorem environments and the proof environment using the extended 
#AMS machinery. Both numbered and unnumbered types are provided. Contrary to the
#plain AMS Theorem module, the different theorem types provided here each have 
#a separate counter (e.g., theorem 1, theorem 2, lemma 1, proposition 1, theorem 3,
#lemma 2, ..., as opposed to theorem 1, theorem 2, lemma 3, proposition 4, ...).
#The numbering's scope is the whole document. For chapter- and section-wide numbering,
#use one of the 'within Sections'/'within Chapters' modules, respectively.
