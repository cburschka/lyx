#  \DeclareLaTeXClass[amsart]{article (AMS, sequential numbering)}
# AMS-Article textclass definition file. Taken from initial LyX source code
# and from the Article textclass definition file, following the AMS sample
# paper "testmath.tex" of January, 1995
# Author : David L. Johnson <dlj0@lehigh.edu>
# The "seq" version has all results, figures, etc., numbered in a separate
# sequence, without section numbers attached (Theorem (1), Corollary (1), Theorem
# (2), etc.).  
# Probably broken by Jean-Marc Lasgouttes <Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr>
# modified and modularized by Emmanuel GUREGHIAN <gureghia@boston.bertin.fr>
