#\DeclareLyXModule{Fix LaTeX}
#DescriptionBegin
#Loads the LaTeX package fixltx2e which contains some bug fixes for LaTeX.
#Those fixes were not part of older LaTeX kernels because of backward compatibility.
#If you use this module your typeset document may look different
#with different LaTeX versions, depending on the respective version of fixltx2e.
#NOTE: recent LaTeX kernels (as of 2015/01/01) include the functionality of
#fixltx2e, so the fixltx2e module becomes obsolete with newer LaTeX distributions.
