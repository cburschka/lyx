# Standard formats for bibliography entries.
#
# This defines how LyX displays bibliographic information in the GUI
# as well as in text/xhtml output. The format of citation references
# is defined in the *.citeengines files, which might override the
# default formatting defined here.
#
# This file is included by the citation engines, so there is no need
# to include it in individual classes.
