Abbreviated Article Title

\begin_layout Author
Woodrow Wilson and Herbert Hoover
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
An abstract should not contain concrete mathematics, but rather should be
 discrete.
 Be brief and avoid using mathematical notation except where absolutely
 necessary, since this brief synopsis will be used by search engines to
 identify your article!
\end_layout

 These styles should

 command, which will result in something like 
\begin_inset Flex URL

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 These links will be active and stylized in the online publication.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
First-level section heading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Section headings use an initial capital letter on the first word, with subsequen
t words lowercase.
 In general, the style of the journal is to leave all section headings unnumbere
d.
 Consult the journal editor if you wish to depart from this and other convention
s.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Second-level heading.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The same goes for second-level headings.
 It is not necessary to add font commands to make the math within heads
 bold and sans serif; this change will occur automatically when the production
 style is applied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Graphics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figures for the 
\shape smallcaps
Monthly
\shape default
 can be submitted as either color or black & white graphics.
 Generally, color graphics will be used for the online publication, and
 converted to black & white images for the print journal.
 We recommend using whatever graphics program you are most comfortable with,
 so long as the submitted graphic is provided as a separate file using a
 standard file format.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For best results, please follow the following guidelines:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Bitmapped file formats---preferably TIFF or JPEG, but not BMP---are appropriate
 for photographs, using a resolution of at least 300 dpi at the final scaled
 size of the image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Line art will reproduce best if provided in vector form, preferably EPS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Alternatively, both photographs and line art can be provided as PDF files.
 Note that creating a PDF does not affect whether the graphic is a bitmap
 or vector; saving a scanned piece of line art as PDF does not convert it
 to scalable line art.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If you generating graphics using a 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

package, please be sure to provide a PDF of the manuscript.
 In the production process, 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout


\backslash

\end_layout

\end_inset

-generated graphics will eventually be converted to more conventional graphics
 so the 
\shape smallcaps
Monthly
\shape default
 can be delivered in e-reader formats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For photos of contributing authors, we prefer photos that are not cropped
 tight to the author's profile, so that production staff can crop the head
 shot to an equal height and width.
 If possible, avoid photographs that have excess shadows or glare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Theorem

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Pythagorean Theorem
\end_layout

\end_inset

Theorems, lemmas, axioms, and the like are stylized using italicized text.
 These environments can be numbered or unnumbered, at the author's discretion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Proofs set in roman (upright) text, and conclude with an

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 (q.e.d.) symbol that is set automatically when you end the proof environment.
 When the proof ends with an equation or other non-text element, you need
 to add

 They are typically unnumbered, but there are no hard-and-fast rules about
 numbering.

Remarks stylize the same as definitions.

received his Ph.D.
 in history and political science from Johns Hopkins University.
 He held visiting positions at Cornell and Wesleyan before joining the faculty
 at Princeton, where he was eventually appointed president of the university.
 Among his proudest accomplishments was the abolition of eating clubs at
 Princeton on the grounds that they were elitist.
