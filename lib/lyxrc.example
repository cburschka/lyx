# The file lyxrc.example is a template to write your own lyxrc file. 
# If you copy/rename it to lyxrc in the current directory, it will
# give global options for all LyX users. It is also possible to copy
# this file to $HOME/.lyx/lyxrc so that the configuration applies to a
# particular user.
#
# Several of these settings have defaults that are auto-detected when you use
# the menu option Options->Reconfigure.  You can see their value by looking at
# the file $HOME/.lyx/lyxrc.defaults. Any setting in this file will override
# the defaults.

#
# BIND SECTION ###########################################################
#

# Before defining your own key-bindings, select one of the available default
# binding sets. These are resource files (like this one) that define a
# large set of (keyboard) bindings. These files live in bind directory of
# the LyX system directory and have in general the .bind suffix.
# Currently, you can choose from the following flavors:
#
# cua.bind            for Windows-, Mac- and Motif-like bindings
# emacs.bind          for Emacs-like bindings.
#
# The \bind_file command looks in the LyX bind directory for a file 
# of the given name, but a full path can also be given. If you have
# a bind file in your ~/.lyx/bind/ directory, it will be preferred
# over a system wide bind file. Default is `cua'.

#\bind_file cua
#\bind_file emacs

# Based on the default, you can now change part or all of it with the
# \bind command. For example, when you want the delete key to do the
# backspace action, uncomment the following line:
#\bind "Delete" "delete-backward"

# However, if you're not at all happy with the default bindings,
# the most logical thing to do would be to use one of the system
# wide bind files as a template and place your own version in
# ~/.lyx/bind/mine_is_best.bind and change the above \bind_file 
# to this instead:
#\bind_file mine_is_best

# Tip: Use "lyx -dbg 4" to survey how LyX interprets your keybindings.


#
# MISC SECTION ###########################################################
#

# Set to false if you don't want the current selection to be replaced
# automatically by what you type. Default is true.
#\auto_region_delete false

# This is the time interval between auto-saves (in seconds).
# 0 means no auto-save, default is 300 for five minutes.
#\autosave 600

# LyX asks for a second confirmation to exit if you exit with changed 
# documents that you don't want to save.  You can turn this confirmation off 
# (LyX will still ask to save changed documents) with the following line.
# We recommend to keep the confirmation, though.
#\exit_confirmation false

# LyX continously displays names of last command executed, along with a list 
# of defined short-cuts for it in the minibuffer.
# It requires some horsepower to function, so you can turn it off, if LyX
# seems slow to you, by uncommenting this line:
#\display_shortcuts false

# Define which program to use to view dvi files here.
# You can include any options you need by "quoting" the entire command.
# You don't need to specify the paper-size and orientation, which is done
# automatically by LyX (hence, your viewer has to interpret the -paper
# option like xdvi does)
# The default is "xdvi".
# Example: the next line would use xdvi and display with shrink 2:
#\view_dvi_command "xdvi -s 2"
# It can get more involved. Expert users might prefer something like:
#\view_dvi_command "xdvi -s 2 -expert -geometry 1014x720+0+0 -keep -margins 1.5"

# LyX assumes that the default papersize should be usletter.  If this is not
# true for your site, use the next line to specify usletter, legal,
# executive, a3, a4, a5, or b5 as the default papersize.
#\default_papersize "a4"

# Define which program to use to view postscript files here.
# You can include any options you need by "quoting" the entire command
# The default is auto-detected, but you might want to override it.
# It is possible to get nice anti-aliased text (slower, but as nice as
# xdvi) by using something like
#\view_ps_command "ghostview -swap -sDEVICE=x11alpha"

# Define which program to use to full screen view included postscript
# pictures. You can not include any options. The default is auto-detected.
#\view_pspic_command ghostview

# Define which program to use to use as postscript interpreter for included
# images.
# You can not include any options. The default is "gs" if it can be found.
# If you have a slow computer, you should consider turning off the WYSIWYG 
# display of includes images, by using this command:
#\ps_command ""

# Define which program to use to run "chktex".
# You should include options that turn different warnings on and off.
# Default is "chktex -n1 -n3 -n6 -n9 -n22 -n25 -n30 -n38"
# Check the ChkTeX documentation for info on what the flags mean.
# Example: use this to ignore warnings about using "\ldots" instead of "..."
#\chktex_command "chktex -n11 -n1 -n3 -n6 -n9 -22 -n25 -n30 -n38"

# Define which program to use to translate latex to HTML.
# You should include options. The default is autodetected: the programs 
# checked are tth, latex2html and hevea, and the default command lines
# used are:  
#\html_command "tth -t < '$$FName' > '$$OutName'"
#\html_command "latex2html -no_subdir -split 0 -show_section_numbers '$$FName'"
#\html_command "hevea -s '$$FName'"
# The variable name $$FName is replaced with the name of the .tex
# file, and $$OutName is replaced with the name of the html file.
# Example: use this to let math be italic with tth.
#\html_command "tth -t -i < '$$FName' > '$$OutName'"

# If you want to pass extra flags to the LinuxDoc sgml scripts, insert them
# here. 
# Example: the next line activates iso-latin1 support:
#\sgml_extra_options -l

# Keyboard Mapping. Use this to set the correct mapping file for your
# keyboard, that is if you need one. You'll need one if you for instance
# want to type German documents on an American keyboard. In that case,
# uncomment these three lines:
#\kbmap true
#\kbmap_primary german
#\kbmap_secondary american
# The following keyboards are supported: american, czech, francais,
# french, german, german-2, magyar, magyar-2, portuges, romanian,
# slovak, slovene, transilvanian, turkish and turkish-f. Check
# the lib/kbd directory if you want to write support for your language.
# If you do, please submit it to lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org.

# The Pause button is defined to be a three-way switch between primary 
# keyboard, secondary keyboard, and no keyboard mapping with the
# following command. It is useful if you want to write in a language
# not directly supported by your keyboard and you have defined a
# custom keyboard mapping above.
#\bind "Pause" "keymap-toggle"

# This starts the lyxserver. The pipes get an additional extension
# '.in' and '.out'. Only for advanced users.
# \serverpipe "/home/chb/.lyxpipe"

# Which command to use to invoke the reLyX script to convert
# LaTeX files to LyX files.  This setting is automatically
# disabled if you do not have the appropriate Perl version
# installed.  In that case, the File->Import LaTeX command
# will be disabled.  If the reLyX command does work for you,
# you can override that here by uncommenting this line:
#\relyx_command "reLyX"
#
# If it doesn't work, you can disable the command by uncommenting
# this line:
#\relyx_command "none"

#
# SCREEN & FONTS SECTION #################################################
#

# DPI (dots per inch) of your monitor is auto-detected by LyX. If that goes 
# wrong, you can override the setting here:
#\screen_dpi 100

# The zoom percentage for screen fonts.
# A setting of 100% will make the fonts roughly the same size as on paper. 
# However, since a screen is wider than a piece of paper, the default setting
# is 150%.
#\screen_zoom 100

# LyX offers a faster method for drawing selected text if you uncomment the 
# following line. The trick is to invert the color-information. This will 
# switch between white and black and give almost random results for
# other colors, so a white background is necessary. Any other settings of 
# the background color will be ignored for this reason. This setting
# is useful on monochrome screens and on slow systems. Fast selection
# can cause cosmetic problems with a few broken X servers.
#\fast_selection true

# If you don't like the default background or selection color, you can
# set your own here:
#\background_color white
#\background_color lightyellow
#
# For reference, the defaults are:
#\background_color linen
#\selection_color lightblue

# LyX normally doesn't update the cursor position if you move the scrollbar.
# If you scroll the cursor off the screen and then start typing LyX will
# move you back to where the cursor was. If you'd prefer to always have the 
# cursor on screen, bounded by the topmost and bottommost visible lines 
# -- much like XEmacs for example -- then uncomment the next line.
#\cursor_follows_scrollbar true

# The screen fonts used to display the text while editing
# The defaults are:
#\screen_font_roman "-*-times"
#\screen_font_sans "-*-helvetica"
#\screen_font_typewriter "-*-courier"

# For some, this font looks better:
#\screen_font_roman "-*-utopia"

# Allow the use of scalable screen fonts? Default is true.
# If you choose "false", LyX will use the closest existing size for a match.
# Use this if the scalable fonts look bad and you have many fixed size fonts.
#\screen_font_scalable false

# Tip: Run lyx as "lyx -dbg 512" to learn which fonts are used.

# The norm for the screen fonts. The default is iso8859-1, which is
# the same as what LaTeX calls latin1.
#\screen_font_encoding iso8859-2

# The font for popups. It is set to 
#    <font_popup>-*-*-*-?-*-*-*-*-<font_encoding>.
# The default  is:
#\screen_font_popup "-*-helvetica-medium-r"

# The font for menus (and groups titles in popups). It is set to 
#    <font_menu>-*-*-*-?-*-*-*-*-<font_encoding>.
# The default  is:
#\screen_font_menu "-*-helvetica-bold-r"

# The font sizes used for calculating the scaling of the screen fonts.
# You should only have to change these if the fonts on your screen look bad,
# in which case you can fine tune the font selection size by size. LyX selects
# font size according to this table, the monitor DPI setting and the current
# zoom setting. 
# The format is:
#\screen_font_sizes tiny smallest smaller small normal large larger largest huge huger
#
# This is the default in LyX (exactly what LaTeX does):
#\screen_font_sizes 5.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 12.0 14.4 17.28 20.74 24.88

#
# TOOLBAR SECTION ########################################################
#

# Setup your favorite Toolbar here:
# Only three commands are allowed inside the begin_toolbar and end_toolbar
# directives: 
#   \add <action> [<parameter>] adds an icon to the toolbar performing
#          "<action> <parameter>"
#      Examples:
#      \add font-size small
#      \add set-emph
#
#   \layouts adds the layouts combo-box to the toolbar
#
#   \separator adds some spacing to the toolbar
#
# These actions have icons (please give us more :-):
#   buffer-open, buffer-close, buffer-print, buffer-write, font-emph,
#   font-noun, font-free, footnote-insert, depth-next, copy, cut, paste,
#   tex-mode, math-mode, marginpar-insert, figure-insert, table-insert,
#   melt, lyx-quit, buffer-export ascii|latex, font-bold, font-sans, 
#   buffer-typeset, buffer-view, buffer-view-ps, symbol_insert [parameter]
#
#  All other lyx commands will get a "unknown" icon.
#
# This is the default toolbar:
#\begin_toolbar
#\layouts
#\add buffer-open
#\add buffer-write
#\add buffer-print
#\separator
#\add cut
#\add copy
#\add paste
#\separator

#\add table-insert
#\end_toolbar

#
# PRINTER SECTION ########################################################
#

# The default printer to print on. If none is specified, LyX will use
# the environment variable PRINTER. If that fails, the default is empty.
#\printer ""

# If you have setup (as we recommend you to do) your print program
# (e.g. dvips) to take advantage of the particularities of the various
# printers you have access to, then you should set the following to
# true. Then LyX will pass the name of the destination printer to your
# print command.
# The default is false, because we have unfortunately to cope with
# people who refuse to take the time to configure their system.
# Note that you will probably have to change \print_spool_command below.
#\print_adapt_output true

# If you don't use dvips, you may specify your favorite print program
# here. See other options at the end of this section to adapt LyX to
# your print program.
#\print_command dvips

# Extra options to pass to printing program after everything 
# else, but before the filename of the DVI file to be printed.
#\print_extra_options ""

# When set, this printer option automatically prints to a file 
# and then calls a separate print spooling program on that file
# with the given name and arguments.
# This is set by default to 'lp' or 'lpr', depending on what your
# system uses. 
# Set this to "" if you have set up dvips so that it sends
# output to the right printer (remember to also use \print_adapt_output).
#\print_spool_command ""

# If you specify a printer name in the print dialog,
# the following argument is prepended along with the printer name
# after the spool command. The default is autodetected, along with
# \print_spool_command determination. 
#\print_spool_printerprefix ""

# Other print related options

# The following options are only of interest to people who do not
# use dvips as print command. You may safely skip to the end of this
# section otherwise.

# These specify the options to pass to the printer program to select the
# corresponding features. These default to the options used for the dvips
# program. Look at the man page for your favorite print program to learn
# which options to use.
# Normally you don't need to change this unless you use something other
# than dvips. 
#\print_evenpage_flag -B
#\print_oddpage_flag -A
#\print_reverse_flag -r 
#\print_landscape_flag "-t landscape"
#\print_pagerange_flag -pp
#\print_copies_flag -c
#\print_collcopies_flag -C
#\print_paper_flag -t
#\print_paper_dimension_flag -T

# Option to pass to the print program to print on a specific printer.
#\print_to_printer -P

# Option to pass to the print program to print to a file.
#\print_to_file -o 

# Extension of printer program output file. Usually .ps
#\print_file_extension .ps

# Sample configuration to use with dvilj4 for a HP Laserjet IV (or
# better) printer [provided by Reuben Thomas <rrt@sc3d.org>]:
#\print_command dvilj4

#\print_adapt_output false


#
# EXPORT SECTION ########################################################
#


# With this you can send a LyX-Document to a User-defined program. You
# can specify by adding the tag $$FName where the filename should be
# put on the defined command. if no $$FName is specified the file is
# sent in standard input (stdin). There is no default command
# specified.  Example: 
#\custom_export_command "kghostview $$FName"

# This is the default for the type of contents to be sent to the export
# command: possible values are lyx, dvi, tex, ps and ascii.
#\custom_export_format ps

#
# TEX SECTION  ###########################################################
#

# LyX tries to auto-detect which command to use to invoke LaTeX(2e).
# If the auto-detection for some reasons fail, you can override it
# here:
#\latex_command latex2e

# The font encoding used for the LaTeX2e fontenc package.
# T1 is highly recommended for non-English languages. LyX uses T1 as a
# default if you have the ec fonts installed on your system.
#\font_encoding T1
# Choose "default" if T1 doesn't work for you for some reason:
#\font_encoding default


#
# FILE SECTION  ##########################################################
#

# The default path for your documents.
# Default is $HOME
#\document_path ~/Documents/

# The file where the last-files information should be stored.
# Default is ~/.lyx/lastfiles
#\lastfiles ~/.lyx_lastfiles

# Maximal number of lastfiles. Up to nine can appear in the file menu.
# Default is four.
#\num_lastfiles 9

# Flag telling whether the lastfiles should be checked for existence.
# Files that does not exist are left out of the lastfiles entries.
# Default is true. If you use slow or removable media, such as networks
# or floppy disks, you can speed up the starting time of LyX by disabling 
# this feature.
#\check_lastfiles false

# The path that LyX will set when offering you to choose a template.
# Default is (System LyX dir)/templates
#\template_path ~/.lyx/templates

# The path that LyX will use to put temporary TeX outputs.
# Default is /tmp/<unique directory for each instance of LyX>
# containing <unique subdirectory for each buffer>
# If you set it, it will be /directory/<unique subdirectory for each buffer>
# (unless set to /tmp).
#\tempdir_path /usr/tmp

# If you set this flag, LyX will always use a temporary directory
# to put TeX outputs into. It is enabled by default.
# This directory is deleted when you quit LyX.
# You might want to avoid using a temporary directory in several
# cases:
# - LaTeX cannot find some files it needs;
# - you have a large number of include files, and you get messages
#   saying that some LaTeX buffers overflow.
# Note that, even if tell LyX not to use a temporary directory, there
# will be cases where it will be forced to: this happens for example
# when typesetting a file in a read-only directory (documentation).
#\use_tempdir false

# This is the maximum line length of an exported ASCII file (LaTeX,
# SGML or plain text). Default is 75. 
#\ascii_linelen 80


#
# FAX SECTION #############################################################
#

# In the following, the <$$something> strings are substituted by
# reasonable values by LyX. The 's are important as there may be spaces in 
# the string. The default is auto-detected.
# This one is what is used with HylaFax:
#\fax_command "sendfax -n -h '$$Host' -c '$$Comment' -x '$$Enterprise' -d '$$Name'@'$$Phone' '$$FName'"
# Use this for the efax-command:
#\fax_command "faxsend '$$Phone' '$$FName'"

# This is the name of your phone book. It's per default situated in ~/.lyx/,
# but you can override that with an absolute path.
#\phone_book phonebook

# This is how to call an external FAX-program instead of the built-in.
# You may also insert $$FName to reference the PostScript file.
#\fax_program "myfaxprg '$$FName'"
#\fax_program tkhylafax

#
# ASCII EXPORT SECTION ###################################################
#

# The following entry can be used to define an external program to
# render tables in the ASCII output. If you specify "none", a simple 
# internal routine is used. The default is auto-detected.
# The following line will use groff and output using latin-1 encoding
# (here $$FName is the input file and the output goes to stdout):
#\ascii_roff_command "groff -t -Tlatin1 $$FName"

#
# SPELLCHECKER SECTION ####################################################
#

# What command runs the spell checker? Default is "ispell" if it is
# installed, "none" otherwise.
# If you have aspell (http://metalab.unc.edu/kevina/aspell/)
# installed and configured, you might want to uncomment the line below.
#\spell_command aspell

# Consider run-together words, such as "notthe" for "not the", as legal 
# words? Default is no. 
#\accept_compound true

# Specify an alternate language. The default is to use the language of 
# document. Uncomment both to enable.
#\use_alt_language true
#\alternate_language dansk

# Specify additional chars that can be part of a word.
#\use_escape_chars true
#\escape_chars "Ê¯Â∆ÿ≈"

# Specify an alternate personal dictionary file. If the file name does not
# begin with "/", $HOME is prefixed. The default is to search for a personal 
# dictionary in both the current directory and $HOME, creating one in $HOME 
# if none is found. The preferred name is constructed by appending ".ispell_" 
# to the base name of the hash file. For example, if you use the English 
# dictionary, your personal dictionary would be named ".ispell_english". 
#\use_personal_dictionary true
#\personal_dictionary .ispell_dansk

# Specify whether to pass the -T input encoding option to ispell (only if the 
# language is different than "default".) Enable this if you can't spellcheck
# words with international letters in them. There have been reports that this
# does not work with all dictionaries, so this is disabled by default.
#\use_input_encoding true
