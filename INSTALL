Note for CVS checkouts
----------------------

If you have checked this out from CVS, you need to have
automake, autoconf, and gettext installed.  Then,
type "./autogen.sh" to build the needed configuration
files and proceed as stated below.

Compiling and installing LyX
============================

Quick compilation guide
-----------------------

These four steps will compile, test and install LyX:

	1) ./configure
	   configures LyX to your system.

	2) make
	   compiles the program.

	3) src/lyx
	   runs the program so you can check it out.

	4) make install
	   will install it. You can use "make install-strip" instead
           if you want a smaller binary. 


Requirements
------------

You will need to have both an Xforms library and Xpm library to compile 
LyX.  It is imperative that you have the correct versions of these 
libraries, and their associated header files.

As of LyX version 1.1.5, you will need to have Xforms library and header
version 0.88 or 0.89.  Version 0.88 is a stable release and the
recommended version.  On some systems, such as linux ELF, there are shared 
library versions of the Xforms library, which require an installation step 
to configure the system.

Xforms is available (free) only in binary format, source code is not
available.  If it is not available for your machine, contact the Xforms
developers to request a version for your system.  You can get it from

    http://world.std.com/~xforms/
    ftp://ncmir.ucsd.edu/pub/xforms/
    ftp://ftp.lyx.org/pub/xforms/
    ftp://ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/X11/gui/xforms
    ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/XFORMS/

In addition, you must have libXpm version 4.7 (or newer; 4.8 rumoured
to work).

libXpm can be found at:
	    http://www.funet.fi/pub/Linux/sunsite/X11/libs/!INDEX.html
	    (or similar locations at other sunsites like sunsite.unc.edu)

You will also need a recent C++ compiler, where recent means that the
compilers are close to C++ standard conforming. Compilers that are
known to compile LyX are gcc 2.8.1 and 2.95.x, the various versions of
egcs and Digital C++ version 6.1. Please tell us your experience with
other compilers. It is _not_ possible to compile LyX with gcc 2.7.x,
and this is not likely to change in the future.

Note that, contrary to LyX 1.0.x, LyX 1.1.x makes great use of C++
Standard Template Library (STL); this means that gcc users will have
to install the relevant libstdc++ library to be able to compile this
version.

If you make modifications to files in src/ (for example by applying a 
patch), you will need to have the GNU gettext package installed, due to 
some dependencies in the makefiles. You can find the latest (alpha) 
version from:

    ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/gettext-0.10.xx.tar.gz.

LyX contains a hack to work around this, but you should not rely too
much on it.


Finally, the two following programs should be available at
configuration time:

  o Perl (at least 5.002) is needed for the reLyX script. reLyX will
    not be installed if perl is not found.  If the environment
    variable PERL is set to point to some program, this value will be
    used, even if the program does no exist (this can be useful if
    the machine on which LyX is built is not the one where it will
    run). 

  o LaTeX2e should be correctly setup for the user you are logged
    as. Otherwise, LyX will not be able to run a number of tests. Note
    that users can run these tests manually with Option->Configure.


Creating the Makefile
---------------------

LyX can be configured using GNU autoconf utility which attempts to guess 
the configuration needed to suit your system.  The standard way to use it 
is described in the file INSTALL.autoconf.  In most cases you will be able 
to create the Makefile by typing

  ./configure

For more complicated cases, LyX configure takes the following specific
flags:

  o --with-extra-lib=DIRECTORY that specifies the path where LyX will find
    extra libraries (Xpm, xforms) it needs.  Defaults to NONE (i.e. search 
    in standard places).  You can specify several directories, separated
    by colons.

  o --with-extra-inc=DIRECTORY that gives the place where LyX will find
    xforms headers.  Defaults to NONE (i.e.  search in standard places).
    You can specify several directories, separated by colons.

  o --with-extra-prefix[=DIRECTORY] that is equivalent to
       --with-extra-lib=DIRECTORY/lib --with-extra-inc=DIRECTORY/include
    If DIRECTORY is not specified, the current prefix is used.

  o --with-lyxname=STRING sets the name of the installed LyX binary and 
    of the LyX library directory to STRING. This may be used to
    compile lyx as lyx-1.1 and avoid clashes with earlier/later
    versions. Default is "lyx". 

  o --with-two-colors=[yes|no] that forces LyX to use two colors pixmaps
    (bitmaps) instead of the full-colored standard ones.  Defaults to no.


There are also flags to control the internationalization support in
LyX:

  o --disable-nls suppresses all internationalization support,
    yielding a somewhat smaller code. 

  o --with-included-gettext forces the use of the included GNU gettext
    library, although you might have another one installed.

  o --with-catgets allows to use the catget() functions which can
    exist on your system.  This can cause problems, though. Use with
    care.

  o You can also set the environment variable LINGUAS to a list of
    language in case ou do not want to install all the translation 
    files. For example, if you are only interested in German and
    Finnish, you can type (with sh or bash)
        export LINGUAS='de fi'
    before running configure.

Moreover, the following generic configure flags may be useful:

  o --prefix=DIRECTORY specifies the root directory to use for
    installation. [defaults to where lyx has already been installed or
    /usr/local]

  o --datadir=DIRECTORY gives the directory where all extra LyX 
    files (lyxrc example, documentation, templates and layouts
    definitions) will be installed. 
    [defaults to ${prefix}/share/lyx${program_suffix}]

  o --bindir=DIRECTORY gives the directory where the lyx binary
    will be installed. [defaults to ${prefix}/bin]

  o --mandir=DIRECTORY gives the directory where the man pages will go.
    [defaults to ${prefix}/man]

Note that the --with-extra-* commands are not really robust when it
comes to use of relative paths.  If you really want to use a relative path
here, you can prepend it with "`pwd`/". 

If you do not like the default compile flags used (-g -O2 on gcc), you can 
set CXXFLAGS variable to other values as follows:

  o CXXFLAGS='-O2' (sh, bash)
  o setenv CXXFLAGS '-O2' (csh, tcsh)

Similarly, if you want to force the use of some specific compiler, you can 
give a value to the CXX variable.

If you encounter problems, please read the section 'Problems' at the end of 
this file. 

In particular, the following options could be useful in some
desperate cases:

  o --with-warnings that make the compiler output more warnings during
    the compilation of LyX.  Opposite is --without-warnings.  By default,
    this flag is on for development versions only.

  o --enable-assertions that make the compilier generater run-time
    code which checks that some variables have sane values. Opposite
    is --disable-assertions.  By default, this flag is on for
    development versions only. 

  o --with-broken-headers that provides prototypes to replace functions
    not correctly defined in SunOS4 and SCO header files.  Its only effect is
    to suppress a few warnings.  It is autodetected by default.

  o --without-latex-config that disables the automatic detection of your
    latex configuration.  This detection is automatically disabled if
    latex cannot be found.  If you find that you have to use this
    flag, please report it as a bug. 

  o --without-liberty suppresses the detection of the -liberty library
    (see the section 'Problems').


Compiling and installing LyX
----------------------------

Once you've got the Makefile created, you just have to type:

  make all
  make install

All should be OK ;)

Since the binaries with debug information tend to be huge (although
this does not affect the run-time memory footprint), you maight want
to strip the lyx binary. In this case replace "make install" with

  make install-strip

BTW: in the images subdirectory there is also a small icon "lyx.xpm",
that can be used to display lyx-documents in filemanagers.

If configure fails for some strange reason
------------------------------------------

Even when configure fails, it creates a Makefile.  You always can check
the contents of this file, modify it and run 'make'.

Compiling For Multiple Architectures
------------------------------------

You can compile LyX for more than one kind of computer at the same
time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their own
directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that supports
the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the directory where
you want the object files and executables to go and run the
`configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the source
code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.

If you have to use a `make' that does not supports the `VPATH'
variable, you have to compile LyX for one architecture at a time in
the source code directory.  After you have installed LyX for one
architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring for another
architecture.

Stripping LyX
-------------

A LyX binary for linux is about 1M when compiled without debug-information 
and with dynamic libraries.  If yours is much bigger you probably compiled 
it with debug-informations (-g).  If you don't want to debug LyX just enter

          strip src/lyx

before installing.  Note that this is done automatically for public
versions.


Problems
--------

This section provides several hints that have been submitted by LyX
team member or users to help compiling on some particular
architectures. If you find that some of this hints are wrong, please
notify us.

  o If you have problems indicating that configure cannot find a part of
    the xforms or Xpm library, use the --with-extra-lib and --with-extra-inc 
    options of configure to specify where these libraries reside.  

  o Configure will seemingly fail to find xpm.h and forms.h on linux if
    you did a 'make mrproper' in the kernel directory, because this
    removes some symbolic links that are needed for compilation. A 'make
    symlinks' in linux kernel sources fixes that.

  o If you have GNU gettext installed on your system (e.g. on linux),
    you will get tons of warnings like:

    bullet_forms.C:101: warning: passing `char *' to argument 1 of
    `__builtin_constant_p(int)' lacks a cast

    These are in harmless warnings caused by a bug in libintl.h, but
    will be solved if you use --with-included-gettext when configuring
    LyX.

  o It is possible to compile lyx with Digital Unix cxx compiler
    version 6.1 (and presumably compaq C++ 6.2 on both Tru64 unix and
    linux/alpha, when this will be available), provided one uses
	CXX=cxx
	CXXFLAGS='-ptr /tmp/lyx_cxx_repository -std strict_ansi -g -O'

    Note that this will not work when compiling directly from the cvs
    repository, due to the tricks used by automake for dependencies. Ask
    Jean-Marc.Lasgouttes@inria.fr for a workaround.

  o On Digital Unix with cxx, you may have a compilation error in
    lyx_main.C if you have GNU gettext installed. This is due to a bug
    in gettext. To solve this, you can either (1) configure with
    --with-included-gettext or (2) add -D__STDC__ to cxx flags.

  o The configure script seems to hang while it is checking the LaTeX setup.
    We think that this is not a real problem, but rather a symptom of the 
    fact that the ec-fonts are being rendered.  This process can take quite 
    some time, so the remedy is simply to have patience. (The fonts need to 
    be rendered at some point to be usable anyways.)

  o According to John Collins <collins@phys.psu.edu>, on SunOS 4.1.3 you may 
    find two sets of X libraries, and they are of course incompatible :-)
    One is the set provided as part of OpenWindows, and one is the standard
    X distribution (e.g., X11R5).  If you encounter problems (or if, for
    some obscure reasons configure cannot find your X libraries) you can
    use the following options:

     o --x-libraries=DIRECTORY that indicates where the X libraries reside.

     o --x-includes=DIRECTORY that indicate where the X include files reside.

    The standard X11R5 libraries should work when the OpenWindows ones
    don't.

  o Some systems lack functions that LyX needs.  To fix this, configure
    tries to link against the -liberty library, if it is available. 
    If you experience problems with missing symbols at link time, you 
    could try to install libiberty.a, which comes with several GNU 
    packages (in particular libg++).  In any case, please report your 
    problems to lyx-devel@lists.lyx.org. 

    The option --without-liberty disable the detection of -liberty.  It
    is meant for debugging purpose only.

  o There are several known bugs in gcc 2.7.xx that cause compiler
    errors.  This is in particular the case in spellchecker.C under
    HP-UX 9.05 (ask Bernhard Iselborn <biselbor@rhrk.uni-kl.de> for
    more comments) and in lyxrc.C under Linux/Alpha or DEC OSF/1.  In
    both cases, the solution is to recompile the offending file
    without optimization and resume the compilation process with
    'make'.    

  o According to David Sundqvist <David_Sundqvist@vd.volvo.se>, some
    changes are needed to compile with aCC on HP-UX 10.20. These are the
    relevant changes in the makefile (with comments tagged on):  

    CXX = /opt/aCC/bin/aCC 
    CXXFLAGS = -O +inst_none # The aCC compiler tries to run instantiations
                             # which currently break.

    LIBS = -lforms -lXpm  -lSM -lICE -lc -lm -lX11 -lCsup # must link with Csup
    LDFLAGS = -L/opt/aCC/lib # perhaps not needed. 


  o On Digital Unix with gcc, you can get warnings like

warning, LyXFamilyNames not found in original or external symbol tables, value defaults to 0

    These concern symbols beginning with an uppercase letter and seems
    to be harmless. Similarly, the compilation can end with the
    following warning:

/bin/ld:
Warning: Linking some objects which contain exception information sections
        and some which do not. This may cause fatal runtime exception handling
        problems (last obj encountered without exceptions was ../intl/libintl.a).


    You can safely ignore it.
