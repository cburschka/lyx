  -- Added a HideFiguresPopups function to hide all figure editing
     popups on buffer switch.
  -- Added insetindex popup to be hidden also
  -- removed insert-figure popup from group to be hidden because it
     will correctly handle readonly buffers and buffer switches
  -- All inset popups that work on a particular instance of an inset
     (recorded by the popup) are now hidden on a buffer switch or
     read-only toggle.

- Mathed's limits bug at parsing time fixed. (Alejandro)
  Hopefully fixed the configurable toolbar. Had to change some in the

  instead. (Check the man page for XStringToKeysym for more information on
  the names for characters). (Asger)

- Partially fixed buffer rebreaks. (Asger)
- Documented ChkTeX in Special Tools. Updated Special Tools in general. (Asger)

    - solves the potential segfaults caused by having popups open
      that expect to be able to change a buffers settings when
      there are no buffers available (ie. after closing last file)
- Rewrote Foils and ItemizeBullets example files (ARRae)
- small cleanup of foils.layout (ARRae)
- configure: fixed the order of multiple directories in --with-extra*
  (JMarc)

- layout.[Ch], lib/layouts/*: added Tags SecNumDepth and TocDepth;
  added support for that where this was needed (JMarc)
- lyxrc: removed tags \paperpagestyle, \papercolumns, \secnumdepth,
  \tocdepth. They do not belong there IMO (JMarc)
- po/Makefile.in.in: added a kludge for people without GNU
  gettext. Tell me whether this works for you (JMarc)
- LyXAction.C: Added cut and paste as forbidden on ro files (JMarc)
- removed references to sos.h since it is currently unused and some
  people have problems compiling it (JMarc)
- insetquotes.C: Added support for so-called ''swedish'' quotes. I
  know these names are stupid, but the user do not see them; fixed
  some bugs there (JMarc)
- text.C, text2.C: fixed some bugs where COMMANDTITLE was not taken as
  a command (JMarc)
- Several Mathed's bugs fixed: (Alejandro)
  o Cursor misplaced after a big operator and a scripted expression, and
    more robustness for array::Resize (thanks Ralf Gugisch for the patch).

    closed with a }.
  o Removed OpenMathInset so math mode always create a new inset, as
    requested by David and Amir.
  o Several fixes and cosmetic enhancements to math-macro.
  o Fixed several (but not all) matrix and label bugs.
  o User defined macro names bugs.

- Improved display of open footnotes, margin notes, etc. (Asger)
- Fix crash on opening of non-lyx file. (Asger)

  will not seem to work because LibFileSearch prefers built_directory to
  system_directory. However, I'm sure it does work. (Asger)
- Fix \kbmap lyxrc flag. (Asger)
- Small clean-ups. (Asger)
- Hopefully fixed all spurious crashes on exit. (Asger)

- added longtable-features \endhead \endfirsthead \endfoot \endlastfoot
  \newpage (Jug)
- added the posibility to force a \parbox{width}{} in a table cell.
  I called this feature "linebreaks" as it inserts the linebreaks
  AS-IS on screen display. This option is only selectable if we have
  something in the width-field (Jug)
- cleaned up the Fax-Facility, as I've seen that some things where
  not quite clear. Doing this I added a message window which pops
  up if the sendfax-command has some std[out/err] output and shows
  this on screen display (Jug)
- Implemented two new commands:
      "end-of-sentence-period-insert" that inserts "\@." bound to C-period.
      "dots-insert" that inserts ". . ." (\dots) bound to M-period.
  Updated documentation to use them. (Asger)
- Improved display of InsetCommands. (Asger)
- Make "Save As..." work better with LinuxDoc. (Asger)
- Continued work on updating UserGuide.lyx. (Asger)

- fixed up bullet_forms patches and regenerated (ARRae)
- added "rm *~" to forms/makefile distclean (ARRae)
- renamed the option --keep-logs of lib/configure to keep-temps, since
  this is more accurate; fixed a bug with sgml-tools there (JMarc)
- updated (not completely) the description of layout files in
  Customization.lyx. Added a small explanation about the use of the
  .lyx/ directory (JMarc)
- Updated UserGuide.lyx: trimmed preamble, updated section on
  bibliography (no BibTeX), removed section on [] and explanations about
  running LaTeX several times, fixed a number of crossrefs and labels,
  added a description of the LaTeX log window, a pointer to
  LaTeXConfig.lyx (JMarc)

  without it gcc 2.6.3 gives an error (ARRae)
- made fdfix also handle scex and idex + lcolor<->lcol (Lgb)
- Improvements in LaTeX runs:
  - Chars ~ $ and % are substituted in filenames because LaTeX chokes on those.
- If LaTeX log contains "Rerun LaTeX.", we rerun LaTeX. (Lgb)
- fixed crash when using a new file name as a line parameter (Petr)
- XForms 0.81 code for the menu_font option (Petr)
- fixed (?) the dreaded configure failure; added a switch --keep-logs
  to lib/configure to help debug problems like that (JMarc)
- added detection of rotating.sty. I hope the description is
  reasonable. (JMarc)
- A few forms have been updated to the popup style sheet. (Asger)
- Fixes in window title updating: When buffer is changed (or saved), the
  window title is updated. Added "(read only)" when buffer is readonly. (Asger)
- LaTeX error box popup enlarged and made resizable and closable. (Asger)
- Various clean-ups. (Asger)
- Fixed idex. It might leak, but that's not a problem because the strings
  live until LyX is closed, so the leak is a close time. (Asger)
- Cleaned up the lib/examples directory. (Asger)
- Fixed crash when loading many documents with lots of insets. (Asger)
- Fixed search backwards bug reported by Allan. (Asger)
- Renamed "Edit->Floats" submenu to "Edit->Floats & Insets". (Asger)

  work correctly (even better when using a (t/g)roff postprocessor :) (Jug)
- Added new debug-flag 4096, which I have to use when looking at the
  roff-output for table-processing, attention with this flag as if
  you use it you have to remove the lyx_tmp(dir) by hand!!! (Jug)
- Extended the Rotation-Support to Table-Cells also. Try it!!! (Jug)
- export ascii text now writes "Abstract" (ARRae)
- export acsii text bug fixed:  (ARRae)
      - now correctly skips over tex embedded in a paragraph
- fixed autosave:  (ARRae)
      - no longer leaves files in TMP_DIR if the rename fails
      - tries writing autosave file directly if failure occurs
- Search/Replace & spellchecker replace fixed. (Asger)
- Implemented lazy loading of textclasses. Force loading on startup with
  "-dbg 1024". (Asger)
- Fixed remove error boxes. (Asger)
- new better and improved scheme for reading the TextClass
  descriptions directly from the layout file at configure time. I am
  sure this will break for many people, but since I use LaTeX for the
  parsing, I should have less problems than with sed; updated the layout
  files (JMarc)
- adapted the layout-reading routines for the new format of
  textclass.lst; removed the newly-introduced Description tag; please
  remove your old textclass.lst files (JMarc)
- fix a bug with the file-name-in-window-title feature, where closing
  the last window caused a crash (Lgb) (I did it first :-)
- A few changes to accomodate DEC cxx (in particular in

  Dialogs (Lgb)

since 0.11.38
- linuxdoc: url{}{} and htmlurl{}{} correctly read in again (Bernhard)
- Rewrite and cleanup of Translation classes. Bindings to accents and
  translation work in a unified (?) way. (alkis)
- major mods to bullet implementation. Split code into separate files,
  slight mods to panel layout, new patches in forms/ (ARRae)
- bullet panel .xpm and .xbm files regenerated that now look clearer
  and have a grey rather than white background.  (ARRae)
- small change to forms/fdfix.sh, sed script now starts line 8 instead
  of line 6 -- required to avoid internationalising two new #includes
  needed for bullet_forms.C -- this shouldn't cause any problems (ARRae)
- added a 'distclean' to forms/makefile, rm's *.orig, *.rej  (ARRae)
- Implemented buffer title in window in a clean-way. (Asger)
- Clean-up, bug-fixes and better error recovery in textclass/layout handling.
  (Asger)
- Textclass definition loading prepared for being made lazy. We just need
  to have the textclass descriptions in textclass.lst, and I'll implement
  lazy layout file loading. That should increase start-up time substantially.
  (Asger)
- Fixed "make srcdoc". (Asger)
- Small fixes in UPGRADING. (Asger)

since 0.11.37
- small change to menus.C to work better with gettext (menu names) (Lgb)
- made a makefile in forms. This can be used to regenerate .C files from
  .fd files. (Lgb)
- New lyxrc option: menu_font. It allows to set the font used for popups
  (FL_NORMAL_STYLE). It is now <menu_font>-*-*-*-?-*-*-*-*-<font_norm>.
  If this font is not available, the popup font is set to
  -*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-*-?-*-*-*-*-*-* as before. The default value
  of menu_font is "-*-helvetica-medium-r". (Petr)
- Some fixes in Introduction.lyx and UserGuide.lyx, but I didn't get all the
  way through UserGuide. (Asger)
- Bug fix in canceled buffer reload. (Asger)
- If emergency saved file exist, ask whether to try to load that. (Asger)
- Changed behaviour of \temp_dir. When this alredy exists it is
  handled like /tmp (so it won't be created, but lyx_tmpXXXXX is
  created instead (Jug)
- fixed small bug in minipage-handling (Jug)
- Made the Table-Layout-Menu a bit smaller (Jug)
- Right-Mouse-Button in tables now moves first the Cursor to
  the position and then opens/updates the Table-Layout-Menu (Jug)
- added support for rotating the tables 90 ', with rotating.sty,
  this works ONLY for Postscript!!! And is NOT WYSIWYMG. (Jug)
- Added new Description tag to layout files; used it in
  Layout/Document; updated layout files to provide descriptions
  (JMarc)
- Added the possibility of having several layout files for the same
  class; the name of the layout file should be
    <classname>_<something>.layout
- renamed the Option tag to Other and moved it into ClassOptions
  (JMarc)
- changed again the way to detect layout files; the format of

  textclass.lst file (JMarc)
- updated the UPGRADING file (JMarc)
- Added a fix for header files when -ansi is set (JMarc)
- cleanup to allow compiling with gcc 2.6.3 (ARRae)

      using LibFileSearch, support for mono also (ARRae)
- bmtable extended: reading xpm's from disk and freeing them also (ARRae)
- fixed lib/Makefile.in to move doc/*.eps also (ARRae)
- detection of algorithm.sty (Bernhard)
- line-length reduction in export of SGML (Bernhard)
- Added "all" keyword for the allowed chars field of \kmod in the
  .kmap files. This will use the native chars that TeX allows for
  each accent. Also cleanup and bug-fixes in Trans and Intl (alkis)
- Moved allowAccents to BufferParams. Also moved get_accent from
  LyXFunc to tex-accent.C (didn't use any LyXFunc state anyway and
  I needed it in TransManager) (alkis)
- Dirty hack to make \bind and Trans work together. Any bindings on
  accents are delegated to Trans which puts them in the default
  keymap (alkis).
- updated the revtex.layout file; fixed a bug with the Option tag;
  separated stdsections.inc inot two files (JMarc)
- added a new boolean tag in layout files (KeepEmpty) as per Juergen's

- applied the change from Falko Sauermann to fixing the disapearing
  layout list bug (JMarc)
- added a hack to help people without GNU gettext to build LyX after
  they have applied patches. You should really install gettext instead
  (JMarc)
- added some support in lib/Makefile.in for a images/ directory (JMarc)
- Improved delimiter dialog: using right mouse button the right
  delimiter is selected, the region displaying the chosen delimiters works
  as the apply button (not yet removed), the chosen delimiters are
  initialized correctly after close/reopen the math panel.  (Alejandro)
- Fixed some (not all) bugs related with matrix: double clearing in Matrix
  and Par destructors caused a segfault (anyway I inserted your patch,
  Henner, for robustness, but an array never should be cleared twice);
  alignment with void cells now seems to work. (Alejandro)
- More bugs caused for the leaks stuff: labels and macros. (Alejandro)
- buffer doesn't jump to cursor anymore when figure gets ready (Henner)
- Sizes of rotated figures are displayed right now (Henner)
- A number of bug fixed. BUGS.lyx updated. (Asger)

	- user input of LaTeX commands
	- example file added to lib/examples
- Small fix: file.C to allow compilation (ARRae)
- Got rid of old ScanLogFile. (Asger)
- Stub for "chktex" support put in buffer.C. (Asger)
- Various mostly cosmetic improvements in source code. (Asger)
- Small bug fixes. (Asger)

  in macros when somebody else removed it. ;-)             (Alejandro)
- Fixed the bug that prevented font changing in math mode. (Alejandro)
- Fixed some incorrect behaviour of ExtraParagraphIndent and inserted
  indent for minipage-paragraphs if the paragraph_separation = indent. (Jug)
- Inserted code for handling footnotes in section-headings (I still need
  a flag in the layout files, as for now the code is always inserted). (Jug)
- From now on you can write paragraphs in a table-cell =:), try to press
  Ctrl-Enter in a table cell. This is NOT WYSIWYG as the linebreaks are
  not written to the output-file. There are sure still some minor bugs
  here but I find this is one of the most important enhacements I made
  for tables. (Jug)
- Write routine for tables updated to "tabular4", to reflect the above
  modifications (this is NOT backward compatible). (Jug)
- Activated definetively the SimpleTeXOneTablePar function and cleaned
  up SimpleTeXOnePar (removed all Table-Stuff). (Jug)
- Added and modified a bunch of functions to text.C, text2.C and paragraph.C
  for the above table-feature. (Jug)
- Added a "Sendto ..." Entry in the File-Menu. This permits you to send
  the file in the actual buffer in LyX-,LaTeX,DVI- or Postscript-Format to
  a command which you define in a Upcoming window. It inserts to a new
  token for lyxrc \sendto_command for which you can define a default
  command for this function. (Jug)

  minipage-environment (purple dotted line on the left). (Jug)
- TableLayout-Menu now comes to front if it is already opened (Jug)
- Fixed Button-(De)Activation in the ParagraphExtra-Layout-Menu (Jug)
- Recoded some things for Minipage and Paragraph-Indent, especially
  now if I (un)set a Paragraph-indent of a List-Environment, it is
  (un)set for the whole List (cause as Jean-Marc advised it really
  don't work if I select it only on ONE List-Env-Paragraph). If I
  set minipage for a List-Environment-Paragraph with a ExtraIndent
  set, the Indent for the whole List-Environment is removed. (Jug)
- Split the function SimpleTeXOnePar into SimpleTeXOnePar and
  SimpleTeXOneTablePar. I need this for the upcoming new features
  as this function is already too large and it would become unable
  to mantain if we don't split it. I did not yet activate this new
  function. (Jug)
- Coded a lot for introducing new Table-Features. You have to #define
  JUG_TEST to be able to test them (they are for not enabled). (Jug)
- New insetparent used as reference for a child's document parent.
  Use "parent-insert <parent filename>".                     (Alejandro)
- New function "reference-back" to return from a referenced
  label or from a child/parent document.                     (Alejandro)
- New function "reference-goto". Should I to explain? :)     (Alejandro)
- Work on new font loading code: FontLoader finished. Now I only need to use
  it in lyxfont.C and that should be it. Will follow soon. (Asger)
- Make "bold" toggle. (Asger)
- Activated new font loading code. (Asger)
- lyxrc spellchecked. (Asger)
- Removed "pc-modern" bindings in favour of CUA style bindings. Created
  "menus.bind" to reduce redundancy and make management of bind files
  easier. (Emacs binding file cleaned up, but bindings are the same
  except for new math bindings as defined in math.bind) (Asger)
- Changed environment variable to use to specify LyX system directory
  from LYX_DIR to LYX_DIR_12 to avoid conflict with LyX 0.10, and future
  versions. (Asger)
- Fixed reference counter problem with LString.C. (Asger)
- Neglible clean-ups. (Asger)
- some small fixes to the buffer files. (altered and removed funcs) (Lgb)

since 0.11.33
- New function char *LyXAction::getActionName(action).   (Alejandro)

  to edit textclass.def if you create a new layout (JMarc)
- renamed layout/textclass.def to textclass.lst and packages.def to
  packages.lst (JMarc)
- added a new tag ObsoletedBy <style> in style definitions. This
  allows the style to be automatically replaced by another one; used
  this to translate transparently LaTeX_Title to Title; removed the
  old Title layout (JMarc)
- fixed the title related layouts in amsart.layout (JMarc)
- Added preliminary support for \minipage-environment (Jug)
- Fixed some inconsistences between Nice and NonNice LaTeX-Output
  (please check if I did it right) (Jug)
- Fixed some problems for IndentedParagraphs, added full
  WYSIWYG (Jug)

  gettextize program, what remains of active support by developers is
  support in configure for gettext. (Lgb)
- configurable toolbar should now work again. (Lgb)
- bufferlist canged to use new and delete dynamically when documents
  are opened and closed. We still have the limit of 50 buffers. I'll remove

- Added the function reference-toggle to toggle an InsetRef
  between REF and PAGE_REF non-interactively. (Alejandro)
- Removed the Reference dialog, it's no more necesary: To go to a label,
  click on a reference inset, to change the reference type, use the function

- Changed umllaut to umlaut in greek-keymap (forgot it before :) (Jug)
- Small fix for errorboxes in tables (Jug)
- Fix for Option-Keyboard do accept other... keyboards and
  a spell from umllaut to umlaut. (Jug)
- New option --with-warnings in configure automatically set to on for
  development versions; this option does not imply -Wno-unused with gcc
  anymore (JMarc)
- Better handling for sgml-tools in lib/configure; since this implied
  a change in chklatex.ltx, it will probably break the OS/2
  configure.cmd (JMarc)
- The file dialog now uses the current buffer's directory as initial
  dir (JMarc)
- " no longer inserts an InsetQuote in TeX mode (JMarc)
- Keybindings should no ignore NumLock setting in Linux (please try
  this!) (JMarc)
- Fix the crash with Options->LaTeX when there is no open file (JMarc)
- Text in TeX mode is no longer broken at spaces (JMarc)
- more work on the VC support (not yet functional) (Lgb)
- some shuffling of code and cleanup (especially to insets). (Lgb)
- work on the error reporting on LaTeX and the use of TeXErrors. (Lgb)
- a preliminary (probably non working) InsetRef to use when inserting
  crossreferences. (Lgb)
- changed InsetLabel to be a subclass of InsetCommand (Lgb)
- added a method BufferView::available() that tells whether there is a
  valid buffer there; used it in many places in the code (JMarc)
- better detection of the C++ compiler in configure (JMarc)
- Break the << and >> ligatures with T1 fonts (JMarc)
- The #warning directives are only active when --with-warnings is set
  (e.g. for development versions) (JMarc)
- A small bugfix in autoconf routines for detecting X (JMarc)
- the current paragraph depth is shown in minibuffer along with the
  current font (JMarc)

since 0.11.29 (0.11.29.1 0.11.29.2)
- removed calls to mktemp and repaced with calls to tmpnam (Lgb)
- some changes to code so that we can remove the -Wno-unused switch (Lgb)
- more work on the Version Control, not yet finished, but a bit closer (Lgb)
- some rework of the tex header files. (Lgb)
- partial reorganization of the LinuxDoc code. It should be little bit
  easier to read. Parts should move in next step to paragraph-class. (Bernhard)
- Display of End-Of-Line marker for ctrl+enter (protected newline). (Asger)
- Backspace much faster. (Asger)
- Assorted minor speed-ups. (Asger)
- Fixed -Mono switch. (Asger)
- Detail bug-fixes/improvements in displaying. (Asger)
- README updated. (Asger)
- BUGS.lyx updated. (Asger)
- several linuxdoc changes, fixes. (Bernhard)
- better handling of Latin1 characters (JMarc)
- quotes should always work now; nicer french quotes (JMarc)
- Added new docs, modified a bit to get along smoothly with 0.11.x (JMarc)
- A few clean-ups for DEC cxx; some changes to BUGS, BUGS.lyx and
  LaTeXConfig.lyx.in (JMarc)
- Fixed mathed's bugs concerning deleting and inserting rows (Alejandro)
- Preliminary text mode under math mode (Alejandro)
- Now the labels browser works again for math labels  (Alejandro)
- Improved the insetinclude class and its dialog  (Alejandro)
- Some fixes to intl.C and to label insets (Alkis)
- renamed [pf]eatures.[Ch] to LaTeXFeatures.[Ch]. This should solve
  problems with existing features.h (JMarc)
- Fixed problem where a new file would be read only (JMarc)
- Fixed a couple of annoying mathed bugs.  (Alejandro)
- Small enhancement to minibuffer.  (Alejandro)
- rewrote Intl. Now passes translation requests to a Trans class. No more
  delete-ing and new-ing when switching kbmaps, Trans is smart enough.
  Added new keyword for .kmap files: kcomb deadkey1 deadkey2 allowed that
  allows you to combine two deadkeys on the same character. (npoly))
- LFUN_BACKSPACE first consults with Trans to see if the cursor has moved
  in the previous keystroke (useful for deadkeys). Backspace will delete
  the previous character (if any was inserted) or cancel the previous
  deadkey. (npoly)
- Intl reads its default values (primary language, secondary language,
  font encoding) from lyxrc. (npoly)

since 0.11.28
- the most uptodate documentation included.
- the keymaps should now be working (almost) correctly. (npoly/Lgb)
- some more changes to the insetinclude (for the better I hope) (Lgb)
- added a new command LFUN_LAYOUTNO (lyx internal only) takes an int instead
  of a string as argument. fixed LFUN_LAYOUT. (Lgb)
- made a new file lyxdraw.[hC] it contains the GC functions and the
  Draw functions from text.C. Also some changes to text.C. (Lgb)
- removed the current_buffer completely from bufferlist, BufferList should
  now be so encapsulated that the buffers at last can be stored as a linked
  list. I have been wanting to do that for 1.5 years!!! However the removal
  of current_buffer can have introduced some minor bugs, but I have not seen
  any so far. (Lgb)
- removed the "Read-Only" popup. (Lgb)
- pre pre alpha preliminary support for RCS, I planned to do this decent,
  but I got caught in cleaning instead. In the prelim support LyX is able
  to detect that a file is under controll by RCS (the file must be made with
  0.11.29 if it shall work correctly. I will complete this promptly on the
  return from my vacation. (Lgb)
- Partly rewrote the Quotes inset (JMarc)
- renamed package.h to features.[Ch] and moved some code there. Inset
  now do their own validation. (JMarc) small fixes to this (Lgb)
- fix UserGuide.lyx so that the EPS figures appear correctly (JMarc)
- A little change to makepatch to make patches shorter (JMarc)
- minipatch to table.C and TableLayout.C
- updated letter-layouts. Created new stdletter.layout and
  updated letter.layout,iletter.layout and dinbrief.layout (Jug)
- updated the file tex/iletter.tex (Jug)
- small fix for New with template (Jug)
- some fixes in LyXLex, there was a wrong handling of \" (Jug)
- fixed the segfault if deleting last row/column from
  Layout-Table-Menu and introduced security check for delete table (Jug)
- Added function lyxaction::getApproxFunc and getApproxFuncName. Allow to get
  a lyx action from an incomplete or approximate string. If the string is
  exactly equal than an action name, the next action is returned.   (Alejandro)
- Improved the minibuffer:   (Alejandro)
  o Added history to store the last MAX_HISTORY commands typed. To browse
    the history use the Up and Down keys while the focus is on the minibufer.
  o Typing tab to get next command in table or to complete the name from
    an approximate or incomplete string (using getApproxFuncName reported
    above). By typing Tab several times you can browse the entire
    function table.
  o As the minibuffer is using now a prehandler as keyboard callback,
    the dirty trick of the hidden buttons are no more necessary so they
    were removed.
- Moved getIncludeonlyList and getReferenceList to buffer.C since they
  are buffer's properties. The reference popup doesn't yet work, maybe
  because some bug in ReturnNextInsetPointer.   (Alejandro)

since 0.11.27
- made possible to change pipe-filenames in monitor-program (Bernhard)
- Allow all extensions by ExpandPath-call in read of Resource
  \serverpipe (Bernhard)
- made paragraph-layout <quote> in LinuxDoc available (Bernhard)
- Fixed a few warnings and bugs found by DEC cxx (JMarc)
- fixed a bug where a LyXLex file was closed twice. (JMarc)
- fixed a buglet in configure with Sun's broken /bin/tr (JMarc)
- a few tweaks to LaTeX preamble generations (JMarc)
- Fixed mathed bug \not{}. (Alejandro)
- Added switch "verbatim" to insetinclude. (Alejandro)
- Improved the Include dialog. Also, button "Load" works. (Alejandro)
- Added destructors to some classes (lyxGUI, lyxMain, lyxserver)
  but aren't used because that "smart" exit.   (Alejandro)
- Three new non-interactive functions for bibtex: bibtex-style,
  bibtex-database-add, bibtex-database-del (guess their mean).
  The cursor has to be in front of the bibtex inset (by now).  (Alejandro)
- Started to implement getIncludeonlyList(). (Alejandro)
- Cleaned lyxfunc of some unuseful arrays and added preliminary message and
  error functions. IMO in a future lyxfunc should not use directly the
  minibuffer but let it's owner to display the messages. (Alejandro)
- Created a mechanism to check out that a command is RO (so I removed
  from lyxfunc a lot of lines). Currently it consist in an attribute table
  that contains only the RO commands but in a future could be expanded
  to include more attributes to all commands.   (Alejandro)
- Improved lyxserver:     (Alejandro)
  o Added destructor. Now lyxserver closes the pipes and
    removes the io callback.
  o Added Error notify, in case that lyxfunc reports an error.
  o Implemented a silly communication protocol: If a client send
    LYXSRV:<clientname>:hello,  LyX will correspond the greeting
    without bothering lyxfunc. So the client will know that LyX is
    listening. If LyX send LYXSRV:<clientname>:bye, the clients
    shouldn't expect nor send more messages.
  o Added function server-get-tip to get a help line about a command.
    btw helpText is now (char const*) because it's not used as LString
    currently and can be easily converted to LString where that's really
    necessary (conclusion: LString is great but please don't abuse)
  o Created a testing tool (server_monitor) as an example on how to
    use the new protocol.
  o Tested with barracuda, the Qt bibtex browser (it works! :)
- New layout file commands Input and NosStyle; Font...EndFont also
  redefines the LabelFont; new layout directive CopyStyle; converted
  several layouts to use a common layout file stdclass.layout. (JMarc)

- Added support for global and layout-specific preambles in
  textclasses (JMarc)
- added support for \lyxline and layouts in Paragraph::validate (JMarc)
- Added a new method LyXLex::GetLongString(endtoken) (used to read
  preambles (JMarc).
- fixed a bug in ascii file output (JMarc)
- LyXLex now closes files that it has opened (JMarc)

  on Tables, which now will open the Table-Layout-Menu or Update
  an already open Window (Jug)
- split LyXLength into LyXLength and LyXGlueLength (Andre)

  o "lot-insert" (Lgb)
- backwardscompability fix in insetlatexaccent (Lgb)
- some changes because of the bufferlist->current() removal (Lgb)

- OS/2 support stuffs in src and configure script replacements.
  Reconfigure from inside LyX does not work yet (SMiyata)
- Mathed bug fixes: {}delims, extra tabs, bold accents, array mess. (Alejandro)
- Added math.bind with some additional math mode key bindings. (Alejandro)
- Partial implementation of buffer-child-open.  (Alejandro)
- Fixed a couple of font related mathed bugs.   (Alejandro)

- some more refinements to LaTeX::run (Lgb)
- preliminary support for multipart documents (Alejandro/Lgb)
- change in ChangeExtension(...) to allow extension="". (Lgb)
- all bufferlist->current() removed. uses now current_view->currentBuffer()
  instead. This is a little better, but this also needs to change, but not
  for 0.12. (Lgb)
- enhanced LyXParagraph::validate() to also validate files included through
  InsetInclude. (Lgb)
- New InsetInclude to support including child documents. Use
  command "buffer-child-insert [filename]" to insert it.        (Alejandro)
- New method LString.rsplit (reverse split). To separate a filename
  and its path use fname = oname.rsplit(path, '/').             (Alejandro)
- First step in integration of new classes for abstraction from
  System-calls (Bernhard)
- Better handling of read-only files. They can't be overwritten now. (Asger)
- Emergency save enhanced: We try to emergency save three different places:
    1) Same place as document.
    2) In HOME directory.
    3) In "/tmp/" directory.
  (Asger)
- Fixed bug with wrong numbering of itemize after "paragraph" and
  "subparagraph" environments. (Asger)
- Fixed stupid bug with setting of font attributes. (Asger)
- Work on system-calls class. Fixed bugs, better error handling and new
  feature: The callback is passed the returnvalue from the child, even if
  it was executed in the background :-) (Asger)

since 0.11.24
- fixed a bug in LaTeX that caused the error message to not show. (Lgb)
- fixed small bug in LString::frontStrip (Lgb)
- redone a large bit of class LaTeX, it now uses checksums to resolve
  LaTeX runs. As far as I can see LaTeX is now never run more than the
  requiered times at any point. It is not totally finished, what remains
  are support for makeindex and bibtex. (Lgb)
- DepTable.[hC] refined. a couple of new funcs. (Lgb)
- the reg...() funcs in bufferparams has been removed (Lgb)
- validate() in lyxparagraph has been enhanced (Lgb)
- rewrote InsetInfo::read (fixed buggy algo) (Lgb)
- added some consts to insets. (Lgb)
- rewrote BufferParams::readPreamble to not use LyXParagraph (Lgb)
- Fixed DefaultFont handling error in buffer.C (ARRae)
- changed from vmargin.sty to geometry.sty (Jug)
- changed also the configure-stuff from vmargin to geometry (Jug)
- fixed bug in lyxrc which does not know about PaperPackages like a4.sty
  look at system.lyxrc for info (Jug)
- added the function CheckToken to lyxlex (I need this) (Jug)
- added the File LaTeXLog.C (guess for what) (Jug)
- added the not activated View Latex-Logfile (Jug)
- improved (?) the code for FontSize and PageStyle textclass options (JMarc)
- cleaned up the code to run LyX in place (JMarc)
- updated BUGS.lyx (JMarc)
- Several mathed bugs fixed.  (Alejandro)
- Improved column alignment in math mode (insert tabs with C-Tab).  (Alejandro)
- Enabled cut & paste between different insets in math mode.   (Alejandro)
- Preliminary support to define interactively macros with two new
  functions "math-macro <name> [nargs]" and "math-macro-arg #". (Alejandro)

since 0.11.23
- New (proof-of-concpet) bannerscreen. (Asger)
- Implemented two new commands:
  layout-copy	Copies current paragraph environment type
  layout-paste	Pastes paragraph environment type
  Bound to "ctrl-C" and "ctrl-V" in pcmodern.bind.
  Bound to "m-W" and "ctrl-Y" in emacs.bind (Asger)
- BUGS.lyx updated to lyx format 2.14. (Asger)
- Fixed problems with missing text after footnotes. (Asger)
- Small fix in math font handling. (Asger)
- LString documentation improved. (Asger)
- Fixed stupid bug with font attributes and changing of layout. (Asger)
- Smallcaps made smaller on screen. I'm not sure it's exactly like LaTeX, but
  it's pretty good. (Asger)
- Added "latin5" to Input Encoding option as H. Turgut Uyar requested. (Asger)
- Reluctant change: Matthias is being phased out as primus motor.
  I don't think it's fair to blame Matthias for the many changes
  we are doing to LyX, so I've removed his signature from the README
  file.  We owe everything to Matthias, so this is an act of respect
  rather than despect. (Asger)
- Fixed some mathed's bugs (Alejandro)
- Typing a space at the end of a math inset will leave math mode and
  insert a space in text mode.  (Alejandro)
- Extended the set of special ($%#&{}_) and ordinary (?)
  characters in mathed.  (Alejandro)
- Added a small space to math function insets (macro-names)  (Alejandro)
- Fixed a few bugs (JMarc)
- Improved Bibtex and BibKey insets (JMarc)
- Added some font effects to file dialog and CREDITS file (JMarc)
- fixed LString::token and a bug reported by David (JMarc)
- hopefully fixed figure rotation and scaling problems (JMarc)
- some clean-up (JMarc)
- some changes to the figinset popup, not very nice yet. (Lgb)
- tried to make the lyxserver work again, it does not... however
  there is probably only small fixing needed to make it work (Lgb)
- reduced xxxinset::descent +3 to +1 (Lgb)
- small patch to filedlg posted to via@ inserted (Lgb)

- Work area now cleared and scrollbar reset after last file closed
  (ARRae)
- some general cleanup (table.h) (Lgb)
- trying to get the lyxserver working again. Not quite done yet. (Lgb)

since 0.11.21
- Redone the whole Page-Layout stuff, now called Paper-Layout (Jug)
- Changed LYX_FORMAT from 2.13 to 2.14. This is needed in order to
  be able to convert the old papersize-stuff to the new format (Jug)
- configure now checks more closely the xforms version; a few fixes
  there (JMarc)
- the default LYX_DIR is now ${prefix}/share/lyx (JMarc)
- compiles with DEC cxx (JMarc)
- LyX is now able to read environmentvariables by reference inside the
  lyxrc-files. (Bernhard)
- New layout tag LatexParam, currently only used to support dinglists
  in foils layout. Provides arguement for environments or commands (ARRae)
- began writing new multirun algorithm (see LaTeX.C) (Lgb)
- included small fix posted to list (Lgb)

since 0.11.20
- Small fixes and clean-ups here and there. (Asger)
- Fixed regular expression matcher. It should be pretty good now. (Asger)
- Optimized screen drawing: LyXText::Draw is twice as fast as before. (Asger)
- Optimized rebreak: 2.8 times as fast on UserGuide.lyx. (Asger)
- Added method "token" (similar to strtok) to LString. (Alejandro)
- New layout tag ClassOption, currently only used for foils' font
  sizes. Doesn't affect standard layouts. (Alejandro)
- Added "default" to pagestyle and fontsize strings. If default
  is used no LaTeX code has to be written. This should be extended
  to other document options.  (Alejandro)
- Fixed some bugs to make bibliography more usable, finished  support
  for nonnumeric bibkeys, added arguments for cite and bibtex
  commands.  (Alejandro)
- Make sure default screen is not larger than monitor (Asger)
- Improvements in font handling. (Asger)
- Massaged LaTeXConfig.lyx.in a bit. (Asger)
- Make LyXLex \r compatible to help OS/2 port. (Asger)

- one line fix in LaTeX.h to make error insets work again. (Lgb)

since 0.11.19
- Tiny fix to configure for xforms 0.86; another tiny fix to sos.* for
  compilers that do not have a real bool type. (JMarc)
- updated lib/configure to check whether your latex program is really
  LaTeX2e; added checks for vmargin.sty and setspace.sty, along with
  documentation in LaTeXConfig.lyx.in (JMarc)
- \ and " are now output using \char when possible. This is better
  understood by the various LaTeX to HTML converters (JMarc)
- Fixed display of Noun and Emph logical font attributes. (Asger)
- In typewriter family fonts, all blanks are generated as "~" in the
  LaTeX file. Other improvements in LaTeX generation. (Asger)
- Added new files: ANNOUNCE, WHATSNEW and UPGRADING to prepare for 0.12.
  Notice that those files are only drafts and ANY comment or request for change
  is asked for. (Asger)
- Misc. fixes. (Asger)
- Finally corrected cosmetic bug introduced in 0.11.13 by me. It turns out
  that the original kernel was bugged with a great performance penalty as a
  consequence.  Now, things should be correct and fast. I think this explains
  why some people have reported bad performance with remote X servers. (Asger)
- Make LyX work with xforms 0.86. Required a little hacking. Primary benefit:
  LaTeX Preamble features scrollbars :-) (Asger)
- Small clean-up in mathed font size selection. (Asger)
- Fixed bugs in automatic system directory detection. (Asger)
- Inserted handling for Vmargin.sty with new Layout-Page-Menu (Jug)
- two small fixes from lyx@via inserted (Lgb)
- added Index List to Insert menu (Lgb)
- added a (nonworing) command to Edit: Show LaTeX Log (Lgb)

since 0.11.18
- update lib/configure to allow running LyX from the build directory;
  it is rather a hack, so tell me if it works (JMarc)
- change \epsfig to \graphics in the generation of lyxrc.defaults; fix
  lyxrc.C to allow reading it (JMarc)
- a backslash is now output as \textbackslash. (JMarc) (Is it?)
- Updated BUGS.lyx (JMarc)
- updated lyx_debug_level everywhere to use lyxerr instead. (Lgb)
- also changed a lot of fprintf(stderr... to lyxerr->print(... (Lgb)
- begun writing of a validate func. (Lgb)
- added a "Comment" style to some of the layouts. This use the
  "verbatim.sty" This is the easy solution, if we want a better solution
  we can do that later. (Lgb)
- added support for setspace.sty It is not complete however, missing
  are support for arbitary spacing and per paragraph spacing. (Lgb)
- some more cleanup (moving of enums from definitons.h) (Lgb)
- two unused functions in lyx_cb.C removed. (Lgb)
- small update to vspace.[hC] (enums) (Lgb)
- Except for "../images/", LyX compiles with only one warning with -pedantic.
  (Asger)
- Implemented "Increase" and "Decrease" size options in character style
  pop-up. Font size names changed to match Rich's second proposal. (Asger)
- Bug fixes in new font code: color should work correctly, LaTeX generating
  bug fixed and improved, reading and writing of underbar correct, and a
  few other fixes. All in all, the new font code seems pretty stable now.
  (Asger)
- Added monitor dpi setting to lyxrc. LyX autodetects this, but it's
  overridable using the "\dpi integer" lyxrc command. This setting is
  used for calculating the size of fonts and vertical spaces. Because
  of this, the default zoom factor has been changed to 150% so the fonts
  are readable. (Asger)
- LyX system directory normalized to reduce "/p1/../p2/" to "/p1/p2/". (Asger)
- LyXGUI is initialized before documents are loaded, unless "-nw" is
  given. The reason is that XForms have to parse the command line before
  we know what arguments are documents and which are not. Also, we have
  GUI warnings and error boxes unless the user specified -nw.  As a different
  side-effect, this fixes lots of bugs. (Asger)
- Added "\document_path" lyxrc command. (Asger)
- All lyxrc commands that supply paths understand "~/" now. (Asger)
- Removed BUGS.lyx from root dir. If you want to read it, you have to
  start lyx, and then it's easier to fetch it under the Help menu.
  Redundancy is bad. The bug file in lib/doc updated. (Asger)
- included part of the OS/2 patch and added support for a
  os2_defines.h header file (JMarc)
- lib/configure now generates a file packages.def containing the list
  of LaTeX packages that have been found ; a few fixes (JMarc)
- Help files are not added to the last files list in the 'Files' menu
  (JMarc)
- support for inputing latin1 characters using the keyboard's compose
  key (JMarc)
- Mathed changes (a lot):   (Alejandro)
  o More natural structure of paragraphs to make easier the introduction
    of selection, macros and possibly a good font renderer in a future.
  o Removed several hacks. Now the design is cleanner but the cleanup
    of the code is not yet finished.
  o Fixed several reported bugs and implemented some suggestions.
  o Renaming to be consistent with the rest of the names. Now the mostly
    used prefix is "Mathed".
  o Builtin macros "binom", "cases", "substack" as a first step toward
    minimal AMS support.
  o Improved selection: multiline, multicolumn. Still some details have
    to be fixed (sometimes it pastes wrong number of columns).
  o Removed pixmap and file from math-inset parameters. That could be
    non-threads safe (depending on how threads be implemented).
- new versions of the docs included so that they will reach a bigger
  audience (Lgb)

since 0.11.17
- 30% speed-up on rebreak gained yet again after profiling :-) (Asger)
- Layout file system changed: The default font can be declared with the same
  syntax as other fonts. Use the "DefaultFont" directive. This supercedes
  the obsolete "defaultfamily", "defaulshape", ... directives. See
  "article.layout" for an example. (Asger)
- Some memory "profiling" reduced executable size from 711k to 675k :-) (Asger)
- Font handling clean-up continued:
  - Font representation changed to mega fast bit table.
  - Old bugs with inheritage of font features in nested environments fixed.
  - LaTeX font change generation changed to use the \textXX{ } variants.
 (Asger)

  whether the reading of a document is complete or not for lyx-format >=2.13.
  (Asger)
- Finally got totally rid of the old math mode. (Asger)
- Font handling cleaned up. Bugs fixed, bugs introduced. This is work in
  progress. Don't report bugs. (Asger)
- Color font property added. Work in progress. (Asger)

- Only show TOC pop-up with Reference guide. (Asger)
- Bug with Insert LaTeX figure hacked around. (Asger)
- 30% speed-up on rebreak after profiling results. (Asger)

  extremely fast, inlined constant time. Abuse as you wish.
  Global srep made local to LString class. (Asger)
- Delay after breaking paragraphs decreased. (Asger)
- Let scrollbar slider fill entire work area when no document is open. (Asger)
- Prevent rebreak when only y coordinate changes. (Asger)
- Prevent crashes when doing stuff on empty work area. (Asger)
- Hundreds of functions changed to use LString const&. (Asger)
- LString speed and memory usage improved. (Asger)
- LString bounds checking removed for non-development releases. (Asger)
- Bugfix in LString::regExp(). "*ab" matches "aab" now. (Asger)
- Various clean-ups. (Asger)
- Bug fix in buffer.C regarding writing of preamble. Lars, we did not
  consider case 0, so it was bugged after all :-) (Asger)
- introduced a class FilePtr to be used instead of FILE* (Lgb)
- made a BufferView class (Lgb)
- got rid of OpenFile OpenAllFile and CloseFile in file.[hC] (Lgb)
- cleaned up FD_form_main a bit. (Lgb)
- added a \noun command to lyx.sty (will do for now) (Lgb)
- moved screen (pointer) from class Buffer to class BufferView (Lgb)
- changed the class LyXScreen representation to have a pixmap per object.
  This introduced some bugs... However either the LyXScreen must have the
  Pixmap as a private variable or the BufferView must have it, eitherway
  it cannot be a shared variable among all the LyXScreens. (Lgb)
- moved some funcs from lyx_cb to BufferView (Lgb)
- moved a couple of funcs from Buffer to BufferView (Lgb)
- the title form is now double buffered and the popup time is reduced to
  10 secs (from 15) (Lgb)
- MenuOpenByName fixed and renamed to openByName() (Lgb)
- small buf in LaTeX::run() fixed. (Lgb)
- LaTeX if now run only once if no more is needed. (Lgb)
- got rid of form1.C.patch. (Lgb)
- probably some more that I don't remember. (Lgb)

since 0.11.16
- added detection of the ec fonts in lib/configure; fixed a few bugs
  there (JMarc)
- new method LString::subst for strings. Hope I implemented it
  correctly (JMarc)
- LexRC::printError() now understand a special string $$Token, which
  is replaced by the current token; used this in various places to
  simplify code  (JMarc)
- most of minibuffer.C interface uses LString now; did the same for
  lyx_gui_misc.C and rewrote a bunch of WriteAlert() and
  minibuffer->Set() calls. (JMarc)
- new function TmpFileName() which interfaces mktemp() (JMarc)
- Fixes to the epsfig handling; the option 'none' is now understood in
  addition to 'default'. (JMarc)
- A few changes in the Makefiles to help the OS/2 port; removed the
  -devel thing in configure  (JMarc)
- Optimized a lot of code after profiling a lyx run with loading of a very big
  document (The Return of Sherlock Holmes). 15% speed-up gained :-) (Asger)
- Small fixes. (Asger)
- Enhanced droplist combox so that you can drop the choices by clicking
  on the text field also. (Asger)
- made a lot of function into member functions of LyXFont (Lgb)
- changed the font loading algorithm a bit, to cope with non
  existant fonts (Lgb)
- fixed a bug in toolbar.C reported on lyx@via (Lgb)
- a lot of font handling updated to use enums instead. (Lgb)
- Make spellchecker work again from menu. (Asger)
- LyX prompts an error if closing a file after saving fails. (Asger)
- Bugfixes in file browser. (Asger)
- Changed LyXLex specs a bit to bug-fix document reading. Bug-fixed 8-bit
  behaviour. (Asger)
- Finished (almost) bibliography support using insetbibkey and a bibref list
  is updated everytime a cite is edited. Changes marked with ale970302,
  looks like a hack until a further cleaning of the code.(Alejandro)

since 0.11.15
- Fixed bugs with accented chars. (Asger)
- Fixed bug that caused |h|o|r|i|z|o|n|t|a|l| lines. (Asger)
- Various clean-ups. (Asger)
- Prepared LyX for use with XForms 0.84. (Asger)
- Fixed problem with labels and -Mono switch. Labels are palegreen now. (Asger)
- fixed the layoutchoice (Lgb)
- began rewrite of intl.[hC], kbmaps are now completely broken (Lgb)
- some fixing on accents, more is needed. (Lgb)
- made buffers keep a list of bufferViews (not fully implemented) (Lgb)
- the menu is now shorter and the layout choice does not show anything
  when no document is loaded. (Lgb)
- the gui init is now last of the inits. This means that no gui is involved
  before late. We can now begin to implement command line switches like:
  o  -nw   (no-window)
  o  -f <func>   execute function (this can only be a subset of functions)
  should be possible to do something like: lyx -nw -f print foobar.lyx  (Lgb)

since 0.11.14
- made preliminary index generation using makeindex work. (Lgb)
- Fixed determination of LyX system dir using $PATH if necessary. (Asger)
- LyX allows spaces in document filenames now :-) (Asger)
- Almost implemented Apropos command, except that I don't know how to get
  the lyxfunc from a global function (see help.C). (Asger)
- Renamed docu.[Ch] to help.[Ch]. (Asger)
- Moved help text from toolbar to LyXFunc::helpText(kb_action). Now, when
  you implement a new command, please add a help-text entry to the table in
  lyx_func.C. Many commands still need better help texts. Later, this
  table can be used to create pop-up menus. (Asger)
- Changed ranges allowed for LString::operator[]: It is not legal to
  access implicit null character at end of string. (Asger)
- Assorted clean ups. (Asger)
- Finished what Jean-Marc started: removed special seperator and
  layouts functions for toolbar. Use the "\layouts" and "\separator"
  commands instead. (Asger, Lgb)
- LyXlex made more robust: reports errors if lines are too long
  instead of crashing. (Asger)
- Fixed Ascent and Decent in a lot of inset because of the above change.(Lgb)
- Some changes that seems to revert recent Lars' changes, but this is
  a dialectic process.  :-)   (Alejandro)
  o No more need to cast (char const*) from long in Dispatch
    (the only action that had been forced to pass a non-char* argument
     (menu->buffer-write), in fact doesn't accept any argument.) ;-)
  o action methods agruped in a new class LyXAction. lyxaction is
    one of the very few objects that deserves to be global.
  o keyseq is part of the internal state of lyxfunc, should not be separated.
    however, keymap can be separated. so I removed bind.C.
  o removed several globals, including dispatch variables that are not
    used outside Dispatch.
  o more unbroken minibuffer; it displays options again and server actions
    can be invoked from the minibuffer
  o some bugs that caused segf when creating toolbar fixed.

since 0.11.13
- added a method LexRC::printError() for printing error messages
  during file parsing; used it in lyxlex.C, layout.C and lyxrc.C  (JMarc)
- Changed toolbar.C to use LString and lyxerr; updated lyxrc (JMarc)
- Changed most occurences of LyXLex::text() to LyXLex::GetString() (JMarc)
- fixed the handling of -g in configure (JMarc)
- fixed the handling of <>|\ for T1 fonts (JMarc)
- unbroke the minibuffer. (Lgb)
- unbroke (almost) the toolbar, some work still needed. (Lgb)
- unbroke keybindings, some work still needed. (Lgb)
- general cleanup + small fix in the bindfiles. (Lgb)
- made lyx backwards compatible with respect to bar (Lgb)

since 0.11.12
- Some cleanups in buffer.C (JMarc)
- The minibuffer is updated when there is a buffer switch; the
  filename now uses MakeDisplayPath (JMarc).
- "Up" is now "Upright" in the Character Layout dialog ; the font
  encoding now correctly defaults to "default"  (JMarc)
- Created the function LibFileSearch() to read library files, and used
  it in several places (JMarc).
- lyxrc.defaut is now automatically read before lyxrc (JMarc).
- fixed a bug in AddPath() when one of the paths is empty (JMarc)
- Allowed again CXXFLAGS to be overriden in configure (JMarc)
- Fixed the appearance of the LyX banner (JMarc)
- Fixed a bug in \lyxtitle{} that I introduced earlier in a so-called
  "cleanup" (JMarc)
- mini-patch in FileInfo.h (jug)
- changed the Document Save Window added Cancel Button (jug)
- Fixed code generation for "--" in typewriter mode to "-{}-". (Asger)
- Obsolete "modern" font state removed. (Asger)
- Micro improvements and bugfixes in lyxrc. (Asger)
- Micro speed- and clean-up by defining LyXFont x = LyXFont... method. (Asger)
- Big performance boost when typing at the end of a paragraph obtained
  by ignoring obscure special case. The code is bugged, but I don't
  understand it enough to fix it. Matthias, can you help? (Asger)
- New InsetCommand class, a smarter InsetLatex.  (Alejandro)
- Preliminary bibliography and BibTeX support using InsetCommand. (Alejandro)
- got rid of three more global variables. (Lgb)
- moved a few funcs out of file.C (Lgb)
- replaced the bar in LyXFont with misc, should be easy to do things like
  crossout or strikethrough now. (a bit buggy yet) (Lgb)
- fixed lyx.fd so that lyx.C.patch is not needed anymore. (Lgb)
- renamed LyXBufferView to LyXView. (Lgb)
- moved the toolbar inside LyXView. (Lgb)
- moved LyXFunc inside LyXView. (Lgb)
- added lots of bugs related to the above changes... (Lgb)
- disabled lyxserver needs some rewrite to function. (Lgb)
- broke the customiable toolbar. If you have your own toolbar
  comment it out for the time being. (Lgb)
- broke all bindings, this should be worked on quite fast.
  However I decided to release a broken bind anyway. The next
  release should come pretty quick. (Lgb)
- renamed LString::isNull and LString::notNull to isEmpty and notEmpty (Lgb)
- broke execution of commands from the minibuffer. The minibuffer should
  be moved into LyXView. (Lgb)
- broke math_panel, it asumes global lyxfunc. Fix is needed. (Lgb)

since 0.11.11
- fixed a stupid bug with <>| (JMarc)
- included Alejandro's small mathed patch. (Lgb)
- made a new class FileInfo, use this to get info about files (Lgb)
- make LyX use #foobar.lyx#, foobar.lyx~, foobar.lyx.emergency (Lgb)
- some cleanup and rewrite in filedlg.[hC] (Lgb)
- got rid of symgen.[hC] Finally!! (Lgb)
- deleted lyxparameters.[hC] (Lgb)
- added Id to all object files. (Lgb)
- check to see if autosave file is newer upon loading a file. (Lgb)
- some cleanup in lyx_cb.C and lyx.h (Lgb)
- fixed a bug in LaTeX::run()/LaTeX::deleteAllFiles() (Lgb)
- Use LString in vspace.[Ch]. Updated all callers. (Andre)

since 0.11.10
- Replaced the documentation file browser by several menu items. The
  files are searched first in user_lyxdir/doc; in particular,
  LaTeXConfig.lyx is found at the right place. (JMarc)
- Added more languages to the languages liste to be up to date with
  babel 3.6 (JMarc)
- Corrected the output of <>|\ in typewriter font; replaced \(..\)
  contructs with \ensuremath{..}}, since this is not fragile. Commented
  out code that conflicts with latin2 encoding. (JMarc)
- Removed the warning when the user_lyxdir/lyxrc file does not exist. (JMarc)
- Completely rewrote the configure script in lib/; it creates a new
  lyxrc.defaults file instead of generating the whole lyxrc. This is
  however useless until LyX reads this file (JMarc).
- Fixed GetBool bug. Sheesh, this is an old one. Wonder why nobody
  noticed... (Asger)
- Fixed bugs in NameToPath() and FileOpenSearch(). (Asger)
- Implemented spellchecker lyxrc commands. (Asger)
- Man page updated. (Asger)
- Included the relevant parts of Petr Mejzlík's latin-2 patch. (Asger)
- Updated lyxrc. (Asger)
- Implemented reconfigure command that starts configure in user lyx
  directory and reloads lyx.defaults. (Asger)
- README updated to new scheme and rearranged such that the most important
  stuff for a general user is at the top. (Asger)
- \input command changed to search current directory, user lyx dir and then
  system lyx directory. This has the nice side-effect that lyxrc.defaults
  is read. (Asger)
- \bind_file command changed to search in user lyx bind dir and then in
  system lyx bind dir. (Asger)
- Removed \lyx_layout_lib lyxrc command. (Asger)
- Changed the ~/.lyx creation process as Jean-Marc suggested. (Asger)
- Changed ~/.lyx dir to be hardcoded, i.e. never ~/.lyx-devel/. (Asger)
- Copyright & Warranty missing display fixed. (Asger)
- Search paths changed to new  ~/.lyx/ scheme: $User/dir;$LyX/dir. (Asger)
- A lot of real fixes that help the OS/2 port without hurting us. Most of
  these changes were present in slightly different form in a patch S. Miyata
  prepared. I suggest that S. Miyata prepares a new OS/2 patch with inclusion
  into the main LyX source distribution in mind. It will hopefully be a lot
  smaller now, and thus no problem for unix LyX. (Asger)
- Removed pedantic question "Are you really sure you want to quit?" (Asger)
- Finally fixed reading error (and removed the strip thing). (Asger)
- Bumped LYX_FORMAT to 2.11. (Asger)
- Fixed file browser in connection with Save As. (Asger)
- A few bug fixes in menus.C and lyxfunc.C. (Asger)
- A few changes and suggestions for LString use in lyx_sendfax_main.C. (Asger)
- Toolbar and scrollbar buttons are borderwidth -2 to provide visual
  feedback. (Asger)
- Copyright and Warranty options merged into one new form. (Asger)
- Credits form text wrapped to meet Jean-Marc's system's demands. (Asger)
- Document, spellchecker and paragraph forms size fixed. (Asger)
- Updated the Ascii-Export and Fax-Support to use LString (Juergen)
- Corrected some bugs in Ascii-Export introduced in 0.11.x (Juergen)
- Remade the Fax-Support-Form to be equal as the other forms
  in LyX (fixed also the FL_CANCEL, for closing form) (Juergen)
- Bug concerning LinuxDoc: Now enumerate and itemize at document-end
  ok. (Bernhard)
- Wrong written 0-Bytes eliminated (Bernhard)
- Bug that caused crash on start-up fixed. (Asger)
- New commands added:
	buffer-fax
	buffer-make-nice-latex
	buffer-make-linuxdoc
	buffer-make-ascii
  Keybindings added. (Asger)
- Started to implement .lyx directory handling. This is incomplete and
  results will be bad. (Asger)
- Label bugs in keyboard form fixed. (Asger)
- Filedialog keyboard handling and close handling rewritten. This
  required quite a few changes and a dirty timer hack because of
  missing xforms modal dialog features (it would have been a snap
  with Qt). Result is that the file dialog is perfect :-) (Asger)
- If you specify a pattern starting with a ".", the file dialog will
  show hidden files (impossible to get such before). (Asger)
- Improved display of long filenames in pop-up dialogs. (Asger)
- Possible to load any filename. (Asger)
- Fixed sources for "config.h" errors, and now the #undef __STRICT_ANSI
  thing works. No warnings when compiling :-) (I didn't fix the
  configure bug that comments out the #undef directive) (Asger)
- Small fix in lyx_cb.C
- Fixed phonebook bugs introduced in my last patch
- Put default path for phonebook to $(HOME)/.lyx/phonebook [user_dir]
- Fixed the above #undef directive and a few other things (JMarc)
- Finished the implementation of .lyx directory handling. A few
  problems remain; renamed system.lyxrc to lyxrc (JMarc)

since 0.11.9
- Font size in all forms changed to FL_NORMAL from FL_MEDIUM to correct
  problems. (Asger)
- When you run "lyx filename.lyx" where filename.lyx does not exist,
  LyX asks if you want to create a new document with this name. (Asger)
- MenuNew and MenuOpen more intelligent. (Asger)
- MenuSaveAs more intelligent and uses file browser. (Asger)
- Fixed a bug which caused problems with the default background
  and selection colors. (Asger)
- Implemented three new commands:
        buffer-typeset-ps: Updates PostScript file.
        buffer-new-template: New file from template.
        buffer-reload: Revert to saved file
  The buffer-new command has been changed to not ask for a template.
  The item "Run LaTeX" in the file menu has been renamed to "Update dvi".
  The buffer-typeset-ps has been added to the file menu as "Update PostScript".
  The buffer-reload has been added to the file menu as "Revert to saved".
- File menu entry Quit renamed to Exit again. This is what Motif, Windows,
  OS/2 and KDE applications uses. Why shouldn't we? (Asger)
- Keybindings updated. (Asger)
- Bug when inserting an empty label name fixed. (Asger)
- lyx_cb.C restructured and somewhat cleaned up. (Asger)
- Main form layout slightly changed. Now, it's not as compact as before, and
  the scollbar is closely attached to the work area and has a new improved
  appearance. Also, a hack makes it possible to position the toolbar where
  the coder wants (previously, it was hardcoded). (Asger)
- Re-implemented the borderwidth -1 setting which got lost in the patch
  plethora (this time it's a global border-width). (Asger)
- A few not-so-good things about Robert's patch fixed:
	<lyx_cb.h> -> "lyx_cb.h"
  and LyX would hang if the spellchecker was closed when a session was
  started. Now, the spellchecker ignores the close-request (temporary
  remedy). (Asger)
- began cleanup that shall lead to multiple frames and buffer visible
  at the same time. (Lgb)
- changed parameter list to lyxfunc Dispatch(char const*, long) so that
  almost everything can be passed as argument (perhaps this should have
  been void* (Lgb)

since 0.11.8(-2)
- #undef'ine __STRICT_ANSI__ when gcc is used to work around -ansi
  problems. (Jean-Marc)
- Fix the code that finds gcc's default include path. (Jean-Marc)
- add a new flag --with-gcc-hack to configure to allow re-compilation
  without optimization after an error. (Jean-Marc)
- remove a few unused files. (Jean-Marc)
- Updated README file. (Asger)
- Comment about -sDEVICE=x11alpha in system.lyxrc.in added. (Asger)
- Help text updated with the new -xpos and -ypos parameters. (Asger)
- Fixed small bug that occurred if you provided background_color, but not
  selection_color. (Asger)
- Made margins in the main window smaller so that the editing area is
  bigger. Should improve usage on small screen. (Asger)
- Fixed wrong \ps_renderer command. Now it's renamed to \ps_picviewer and
  system.lyxrc.in has been updated accordingly. Thanks for Jean-Marc for
  discovering this one. (Asger)
- Math hard-space display bug fixed. (Asger)
- Renamed latex.[Ch fd] to latexoptions.[Ch fd] to avoid namespace conflict
  on case-insensitive platforms (OS-2). (Asger)
- A few other small fixes. (Asger)
- Moved CREDITS file to lib/ directory. Makefile.in updated. (Asger)
- Updated man page. (Asger)
- All forms redesigned to be 100dpi compatible and usable on 640x480
  displays. Many forms are now smaller. (Asger)
- Cross-reference dialog improved. (Asger)
- Valsliders in document form changed to counters. (Asger)
- Graphics for math decorations improved. (Asger)
- New spellchecking option: Input Encoding option for ispell. (Asger)
- Use "visual: default" instead of the "depth:8" which caused problems.
  I think this solution is better than "depth:best" which introduces
  warnings on my display. I hope this works for everybody. XForms
  does not provide good support in this area. (Asger)
- Implemented new options: -xpos and -ypos that specify where the
  main form should be positioned. You have to specify both x and y
  before the position is used. Negative positions are ignored.
  If no valid position is specified, the default is to center the main form.
  Remember that all command line switches can also be given as X
  resources. Now I happily have
      lyx*width: 1016
      lyx*height: 712
      lyx*xpos: 0
      lyx*ypos: 0
  in my .Xdefaults. (Asger)
- The file dialog does not display hidden files. (Asger)
- Created two functions in lyx_cb.C: CancelCloseBoxCB() and
  IgnoreCloseBoxCB() that do nothing and return FL_CANCEL and
  FL_IGNORE resp. Added lots of fl_set_form_atclose() calls (one
  for each form) to protect LyX from being killed when a dialog's
  close box is pressed. In most situations CancelCloseBoxCB is
  hooked in, which is like pressing the Cancel button. In some
  situiations, however, IgnoreCloseBoxCB was used (fax and file
  dialogs), because using the Cancel variation resulted in strange
  behavior. The authors of fax and file dialogs should look into
  it. (RvdK)
- Couldn't help it. Once again changed the GUI depth from 2 to 1
  pixel. I promise I won't change it again, so if you don't like
  it, replace the -1 in -2 again in LyXGUI::setDefaults(). (RvdK)
- replaced int FontEqual(...) with bool operator==(...) (and !=)(Lgb)
- cleaned up a little namespace pollution (Lgb)

since 0.11.7
- Finally implemented MakeDisplayPath and RegexpMatch so that the
  pattern in the filebrowser is respected. Also, links are
  displayed correctly in the filebrowser now.
  Now it seems that the introduction of LString to all path and
  filename stuff has been completed. (Asger)
- Fixed a bug in the fileselector. (Asger)
- Implemented \ps_renderer lyxrc command to allow setting of which
  program to use for rendering postscript pictures. (Asger)
- Implemented \ps_viewer and \dvi_viewer lyxrc commands to allow
  setting of which programs to use to view postscript and dvi files
  respectively. The \dvi_viewer command make the old xdvi_options
  command obsolete. system.lyxrc updated to reflect all of this.
  Also updated menus to reflect this.
  *NOTICE* Change of short-cut keys in file menu. (Asger)
- Fixed determination of LyX system dir as Jean-Marc suggested. (Asger)
- Fix bugs in Makefile.in regarding make bindist. (Asger)
- Fixed few bugs in man page. (Asger)
- New way of determining the LyX system directory: (Asger)
 	// Directories are searched in this order:
	// 1) LYX_DIR environment variable
	// 2) path of binary/../
	// 3) path of binary/../lib/name of binary/
	// 4) hardcoded lyx_dir
	// The direcory is checked for the present of the file
	// "chkconfig.ltx", and if that is present, the directory
	// is accepted as the system directory.
	// If no chkconfig.ltx file is found, a warning is given,
	// and the hardcoded lyx_dir is used.
- New command line options: -help and --help (Asger)
- Small bugfixes. (Asger)
- moved the files around to reduce the clutter in the main directory;
  removed some old files. (Jean-Marc)
- moved the data files in the lib/ directory. Changed the directory
  search rule 2) above to "path of binary/../lib" (Jean-Marc)
- implemented the new and improved configuration tool in
  lib/. (Jean-Marc)
- added a replacement for the strerror() function for SunOS 4.1.[123]
  (Jean-Marc and Stephan)
- added -ansi has a default gcc compile flag (Jean-Marc)
- minor bug fix in buffer.C (Jean-Marc)
- output characters [, ] and * between curly braces to avoid problems
  with optional arguments (with e.g. \item and \\) (Jean-Marc)
- small cosmetic changes in lyx_sty.h (Jean-Marc)
- Added new document parameter "Default Skip".  Used for parskip when
  separation method is "skip"; and for individual detached paragraphs
  when separation method is "indent".  Added new user functions
  "break-paragraph-skip", "delete-backward-skip", "delete-forward-skip",
  for easy input of detached paragraphs. (Andre)

since 0.11.6
- Some of the stuff that Shreeniwas redone or reversed because of
  problems with other compilers. (Asger)
- Some work done to use Error-class. (Asger)
- Spellchecked a bunch of files, and cleaned README as Alejandro
  suggested. (Asger)
- Shreeniwas Sapre const-char cleaned LyX and some other stuff.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs, and now even the fileselector works. (Asger)
- removed support for old lyx format. (Lgb)
- fix in NameToPath (caused index error) (Lgb)
- removed a couple of leaks. (Lgb)

since 0.11.5
- 80 files changed to use LString more. A number of bugs fixed, and
  a number of bugs introduced.(and removed) (Asger)
- added rotation of wysiwyg-figures. (Henner)
- Tried to fix (again!) the interaction between " and german styles (Jean-Marc)
- Cosmetic changes to paper.layout (Jean-Marc)
- Added "glue" to LyXLengths. In the Layout Paragraph dialog, Vertical
  Spaces, you may write now: "1cm +4mm -2mm", "1+0.1-0.2 in", or
  "10+-2pt", for example. (Andre)
- Fixed some bugs related to the introduction of "char const*".  (Alejandro)
- Back to don't skip a char to leave mathed with arrow keys. (Alejandro)

since 0.11.4
- Converted to LString, documented and bugfixed inseterror, insetinfo,
  insetlatex and insetlatexdel, and some other small stuff. (Asger)
- Changed way of opening insets from doubleclick to singleclick. Now
  doubleclick is only used for selecting words, and everything is
  logical IMO. (Asger)
- added `-devel' suffix to the name of LyX binary and LYX_DIR for
  development version. Bug fixes to configure (Jean-Marc)
- several changes here and there to help compile with DEC's cxx, which
  looks very picky. (Jean-Marc)
- Enhanced layout paragraph dialog, disallow illegal input. (Andre Spiegel)
- switch from "const char *" to "char const *" (Lgb)
- more stringificaton and lyxlexifications (Lgb)
- added a bug that won't go awat :-( (Lgb)

since 0.11.3
- Implemented new display of optional hyphens: a small red dot
  and converted insetlatexdel.[Ch] to use LString. (Asger)
- Fixed a number of LString bugs in insetlatexaccent.C. (Asger)
- Fixed a typo in lastfiles.C. (Asger)
- obviously very last kernel-bug fixed ;-) (Matthias) (0.10.8)
- Enhanced Vertical Spaces in the Layout Paragraph dialog. (Andre Spiegel)
- Added more units to LyXLength + other small changes (Lgb)
- LyX can now be built for several architectures simultaneously, as
  long as your Makefile understands `VPATH' (Jean-Marc)
- small configure fixes (Jean-Marc)
- LString fix and addons (Lgb)
- fix to layout combox (LyX)
- some more changes to InsetLaTeXAccent (Lgb)
- implemented algorithm for multiple LaTeX runs (Lgb)
- switched to autoconf 2.11. Things are somehow cleaner, but there
  might be new bugs (Jean-Marc).
- 'make depend' now uses X11's makedepend by default (Jean-Marc)
- commented out the 'abstract' layout in book.layout (Jean-Marc)
- lyx now uses lyxlex to do the file reading (almost), however I have not
  been able to track down all the bugs, so please help (Lgb)
- also recursive decent through the paragraphs when printing (Lgb)
- a new function in lyxlex nextToken (Lgb)
- fix in Makefile.in to make (gnu)depend work. added -I../images (Lgb)

since 0.11.2
- Implemented two new lyxrc commands: (Asger)
    \num_lastfiles int -> defines the maximal number of lastfiles
    \check_lastfiles bool -> should the lastfiles be checked for existance?
- Small changes in comments in system.lyxrc. (Asger)
- Changed default width of Ascii export from 80 to 75. (Asger)
- Implemented display of current document's filename in window title. For
  this, I introduced a new file: lyx_gui_misc.[Ch] where different,
  simple GUI specific routines should go. (Asger) (not used yet)
- A bunch of spelling errors in comments all over corrected. (Asger)
- New info in README: how to submit a patch, other internet resources.
  More finetuning. I'm getting tired of README :-) (Asger)
- Bugfixes in lastfiles. It should be pretty robust now. (Asger)
- Changed behaviour on how to open floats like footnotes and margin notes:

  without time-out. (RvdK).
- When a prefix key is entered, the available key options appear after one
  second in the minibuffer. (Rvdk)
- Possible to execute commands from minibuffer. (Lgb) (not very clever done)
  it is not even possible to see what you write :-(
- change to InsetFig::Browsefile (thornley)
- made a MiniBuffer class (methods: Set, Init, and expose) (Lgb)

since 0.9.16
- configure updates : removed support for installing lyx.sty, for xforms 0.75,
  updated INSTALL file, removed a few macros from lyx_sty.h and enclosed
  it in \makeatletter ... \makeatother (Jean-Marc)
- fiddling in lyx_sty.h (Lgb)
- new bindable function: push-toolbar(int nth) and a hack in
  create_form_form_main so that other objs can know where
  the toolbar is. (not finished) (Lgb)
- Class Inset split into two classes: interaction methods
  now are placed in UpdatableInset class, and the_locking_inset
  is an object of this class.  (Alejandro)
- All references to Displaymath layout removed from formula.C.
  Now lyx should center a mathinset if its method
  Display() returns true. Also, for a clean scrolling, the
  method HotSpot returns the position of the inset, since
  a mathinset moves current lyx cursor.  (Alejandro)
- Now Mathed supports Arrays, eqnarrays and numbered equations.  (Alejandro)

  things.

since 1.05
- Motif2.0 fix: When the layouts combobox was
  set to another layout (for example when moving

  to the paragraphs like vertical spaces etc. where
  reseted to the default values.
  This bug didn't occur with Motif < 2.0

  a lot of segementationt faults (that nowbody told
  me :-( ) occurred on systems that had other fonts
  installed.

  user defined preambles, generated tex-code)

  is. This is better, since the dvi-file may need
  pictures.
