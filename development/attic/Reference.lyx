Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
About this Document
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the LyX 
\emph on
Reference
\emph default
 
\emph on
Manual
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you've looked at some of the other documentation, you might be expecting
 this section to be identical to all of the other opening sections in the
 other documentation files.
 The Reference Manual isn't like the other documents, and requires a somewhat
 different approach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, this file is big.
 It contains \SpecialChar \ldots{}
well, everything.
 Or, it will, at some point.
 At the moment, though, it's still somewhat incomplete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Second, to help you get started with this manual, we recommend that you
 have a look at the example entries.
 We'd also recommend not printing out the entire manual, but only those
 sections you happen to need.
 [This document is still a moving target, after all.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Third, the entries in this manual follow a somewhat-modified version of
 the format described in the 
\emph on
Introduction
\emph default
 manual.
 Most of these modifications are additions to what's been specified in the
 Style Sheet.
 So, if you intend to add an entry, make sure you read 
\family typewriter
DocStyle.lyx
\family default
 thoroughly! [You'll find it in the distribution in the 
\family typewriter
development
\family default
 subdirectory.]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
NOTE: this document is, alas, very out of date.
 It is wrong in many places, and omits lots of information about newer versions
 of LyX.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Organization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each chapter is grouped around a central theme or topic.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ch:user-interface"

\end_inset

 describes the user interface.
 Included are the tool bar, the various popups and which menu items and
 keys they are bound to.
 Chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ch:functions"

\end_inset

 lists all of the bindable functions.
 You'll need this information if you want to alter the key bindings or create
 your own tool bar.
 Lastly, chapter 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "ch:misc"

\end_inset

 is the Dreaded Miscellaneous! Basically, anything we couldn't figure out
 where to put ended up here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The entries themselves are the subsections of each chapter.
 They are in alphabetical order for ease of access.
 The sections of each chapter have single purpose: to split up the chapter
 into more manageable chunks.
 They simply group the entries by letter, so, for example, there will be
 a section labelled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

A-C,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 another called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

S,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
A Sample Entry
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a sample entry to the Reference Manual.
 It should help readers figure out how to use this manual, and show developers
 how to create entries.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first thing to notice it the entry name.
 It's not in any special font.
 Now, according to the Style Sheet, function names should be in 
\family typewriter
Typewriter
\family default
 font and the names of popups in 
\family sans
Sans
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Serif
\family default
.
 If you check the chapters containing entries for the functions and popups,
 you'll see that those entries do indeed use this font convention\SpecialChar \ldots{}
in the
 text itself.
 The names of the entries --- i.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

e.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

the subsection title --- is in the default font.
 Leave the entry titles in the default font.
\end_layout

\series default
 Where in the menus you can find this thing.
 If the menu item just brings up a dialog box, put its name in as a 
\family sans
\emph on
Description
\family default
\emph default
 list.
 Also put in where on the panel the item in bound.
 Put the names of menus, popup buttons, etc.
 in 
\family sans
Sans Serif
\family default
 to make it stand out from any other text.
 Underline the accelerator key, if any.

 There will be either one or two paragraphs here.
 They should just contain a key sequence, and the name of the binding file.
 Put the name of the binding file in 
\family typewriter
Typewriter
\family default
 font, and the key sequence in 
\family sans
Sans Serif
\family default
 to make it stand out.
 If no binding file name is present, then that binding is standard in all
 of the binding files.
 Example:
\end_layout

\begin_deeper

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Standard
There won't always be one of these.
 In fact, any of the

standard
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sections of an entry may be missing, especially if it's empty.
 For example, there are only 15 or so toolbar buttons, so most things won't
 have a default toolbar binding.

Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This item puts extra bogosity in your documents by activating the bogofilter
 in BoGoTeX.
 Everyone needs a little bogosity in their writings.
 Otherwise, you risk boring your readers into a deep sleep.
 In fact, some science professors, scoffing at the usefulness of the BoGoTeX
 extensions, have written and even published articles in reputable journals
 that have been known to put readers into a coma! Don't believe me? Try
 reading just about any scientific paper!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just select the text to bogosify with the mouse, then use the keyboard bindings,

\begin_layout Standard
We all know how much cats

 computers, especially the laps that sit in front of them.
 However, a cat, being feline, must add its opinions to whatever you're
 typing.
 Or, your cat may simply decide to help you finish your work so you can
 get to more important matters, such as brushing and petting.
 The decat function is designed for just such moments.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Select the text to decat while holding down all five mouse buttons, then
 use the keyboard bindings, toolbar button, or menu item for this function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A particular black and white cat once added the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\SpecialChar \ldots{}
to a document.
 Run through decat, it became:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another frisky kitty named Horatio added: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote

\begin_layout Standard
to some text.
 Decat changed it to:

If a particular piece of an entry is missing, it's equivalent to saying,
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

There is none.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 For example, if, under 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold

\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 there was no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold
Menu
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 item, it means there is no menu binding.
 Likewise, the guy who wrote the entry may have decided that the function's
 purpose is self-explanatory.
 So, there'd be no

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command has several purposes, depending on context.
 Its primary function is to manually end a line without ending the paragraph.
 This should only be done when you need some fine-tuning.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To terminate the current paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command does slightly different things, depending on context.
 Typically, it ends the current paragraph, breaks the current line, and
 starts a new paragraph in the 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
 paragraph environment on the next line.
 It also typically removes all environment nesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are in the middle of a paragraph, 
\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 splits it in two.
 If the paragraph is a list item, it creates a new list item in the process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are at the end of a paragraph, 
\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 starts the new paragraph after the current one.
 If you are at the beginning of a paragraph, the new paragraph starts 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 the current one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 may start the new paragraph in an environment other than 
\family sans
Standard
\family default
, but the behavior is not consistent.
 For example, if you move to the middle of an 
\family sans
Itemize
\family default
 list, to the end of one of the items or the beginning of the next item,
 
\family typewriter
break-paragraph
\family default
 will not change the paragraph environment.
 It will still mess up the environment nesting, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
None.
 Your best bet is to just play with hitting return until you build an intuition
 for how this works.

Usage:

Its usage is very much the same as

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's not easy to provide an example for this one.
 If you don't know LaTeX, and never intend to insert any LaTeX code into
 your LyX documents, you might not need to worry about this command.
 It's here for those users who

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This function opens the

\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\begin_layout Standard
You'll get slightly different behavior depending on which type you select.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This panel previously had a third option, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\family sans

, for inclusion of LaTeX graphics.
 This function is now provided by means of the 
\family sans

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Placement is the difference in the two options.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
Inlined EPS
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 inserts the graphics within the current line, as if it were a normal character.
 This can have remarkably bizarre results on the line spacing if the imported
 graphics is very tall.
 The other option, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans
Encapsulated Postscript
\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, breaks the current line on either side of the figure, separating it from
 the text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this function merely creates a box for the appropriate graphics.
 You must still choose the file to import.
 For PostScript® files, double click on the box, which will initially contain
 only the letter 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

F
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to open the

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Changes the font to an emboldened series or, if the font is already emboldened,
 reverts to the default series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rather than repeat the same thing for all 9 font selection functions, we'll
 describe the generic behavior of the font functions here.
 Some of the font commands have a toolbar button, others have a menu selection.
 All of them are in the 
\family sans
Character Layout
\family default
 popup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of the font commands do the following to words:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the cursor is in the middle of a word [between two whitespaces], the
 entire word changes to the new font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the cursor is at the beginning or end of a word, the font commands only
 affect any subsequently typed text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can also tack text in a different font onto a word.
 Just move the cursor out of the word to shut off the font, otherwise, you'll
 change the whole word into a single font.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also change the font of a block of text by selecting it with the
 mouse [or with the keyboard] and then invoking the font command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Eight of the font commands, 
\family typewriter
font-code
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
font-emph
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
font-roman
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
font-sans
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
font-size
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
font-smallcaps
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
font-underline
\family default
, and 
\family typewriter
font-bold
\family default
, are toggles.
 They will remove a font if text is already in it and deactivate a font
 if it's active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LyX automatically uses the font of the word next to the cursor.
 If the cursor is in the middle of a word, it uses the font of the text
 to the right of the cursor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last thing: we've provided this function because LaTeX has a bold font
 series.
 We know that many users are used to using boldface for emphasis, and you
 can make this the default emphasized font by putting the correct command
 in the LaTeX preamble.
 However, we suggest that you use 
\family typewriter
font-emph
\family default
 to emphasize any text and only use 
\family typewriter
font-bold
\family default
 when appropriate.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For example, to make reference to a vector in the body of the text, many
 mathematician use a bold series.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is an example of a bold font series:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\series bold
This is bold text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose you have this sentence:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Here is some text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you put the cursor in the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

some
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and invoke 
\family typewriter

\family default
, you get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you take the first example, select the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

This is,
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, you get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\series medium

bold text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now put the cursor at the end of the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

text.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Delete the period, invoke 
\family typewriter
font-bold
\family default

 You'll get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
This is

and this is not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you take the sentence,

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 put the cursor before the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

, and type in some text, you'll get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation
Here is some 
\series bold

\series default
 text.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now put the cursor after the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 You'll get:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lastly, we'll demonstrate mixed fonts.
 Again, start with the sentence, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Here is some text.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 We can do the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quotation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

; and 7) moving the cursor out of the word.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last step automatically shuts off the bold font.
 LyX automatically uses the font of the current word [the word next to the
 cursor].
 If you had not moved the cursor, but instead tried to turn off bold font

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A lot of the usage for 
\family typewriter
font-emph
\family default
 works the same way as 
\family typewriter
font-bold
\family default
, so see the entry for 
\family typewriter

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many new users wonder why this isn't called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

font-italic,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and why boldface and underlined text don't have their own menu entries
 or toolbar buttons.
 LyX has adopted a convention from LaTeX: specify 
\emph on
what
\emph default
 you want to do and let the computer take care of how to do it.
 The italic font shape is the standard way to emphasize text in typesetting.
 LyX [and LaTeX] has also adopted this convention.
 You can, of course, change which font is the emphasized font by making
 the appropriate changes to the LaTeX preamble, although this will only
 affect the final output.
 There are also some interesting things that LaTeX will do to emphasized
 text that LyX can't [yet] display.
 It will still be in the final output.
 For example, LaTeX does certain things for emphasized emphasized text automatic
ally.
 If you used a specific font, you'd need to do the same thing manually,
 using specific font changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In short, the LyX team 
\emph on
strongly recommends
\emph default
 that you use 
\family typewriter
font-emph
\family default
 to emphasize any text [this includes book titles] and save any specific
 font command for those few special cases where you need to specify exactly
 how the text is typeset.

 Some countries use this convention more frequently than the US does, hence
 its prominence in LyX.

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LyX team has provided this function only for compatibility with LaTeX.
 We know that many users are used to underlining text for emphasis or for
 book titles.
 While you might need to do this on a typewriter, LyX is not a typewriter,
 nor should you use it like one.
 Now, you could make this the default emphasized font by putting the correct
 command in the LaTeX preamble.
 However, we suggest that you use 
\family typewriter
font-emph
\family default
 to emphasize any text, including book titles, and avoid using 
\family typewriter
font-underline
\family default
 at all.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is one - and only one - case that we can think of where you might
 need to use 
\family typewriter
font-underline
\family default
.
 Suppose you're writing the bibliography of a journal article.
 The journal you're submitting this article to typesets all volume numbers
 in an underlined font, and wishes all submissions to do the same.
 This is perhaps the only time you'd need to use 
\family typewriter
font-underline
\family default
.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the keyboard, menu, or toolbar to insert a footnote.
 A red box appears on the next line.
 If you're in the middle of a line, the line appears to break around the
 box [it doesn't really].
 Anything you enter in the box will be in the footnote.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Quotes eld

 written in red on a grey background.
 Click on this box once with the left mouse button to close the footnote.
 A closed footnote looks like the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family sans

\family default

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 written as a superscript in red.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can also open and close footnotes, as well as other types of notes and
 labels, with the 
\family typewriter
open-stuff
\family default
 command.
 See its entry for keybindings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One last note: even though footnotes in LyX appear unnumbered, they are.
 LaTeX does the numbering for you, as well as putting the footnote at the
 bottom of the correct page, when it processes your file.

 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LaTeX 
\family typewriter

\backslash
hfill
\family default
 stands for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horizontal fill.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 As the name implies, an 
\emph on
HFill
\emph default
 fills in the current line with blank space.
 You can put it at the beginning or end of a line, which will force the
 line against the right or left margin, respectively.
 However, an 
\emph on
HFill
\emph default
 is most useful in the middle of a line.
 The example explains it best.
 The 
\emph on
HFill
\emph default
 has pushed the text on either side of it to the left and right margins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Important Note: by a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

margin,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we do 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 mean the page margins.
 We mean the environment margin.
 For example, if your document has two columns per page, an 
\emph on
HFill
\emph default
 fills in the line to the left and right margin 
\emph on
of the column
\emph default
, not the entire page.
 If you're in a table cell, 
\emph on
HFill
\emph default
 fills to the cell borders, and so on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You should only use 
\family typewriter
hfill-insert
\family default
 for fine tuning.
 LyX has better ways to justify and format text.

Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While LaTeX is normally able to hyphenate most words, it has problems with
 other words, especially non-English words and technical terms.
 This command allows you to tell LaTeX to hyphenate a single instance of
 a word that LaTeX would otherwise be unable to hyphenate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To allow LaTeX to properly hyphenate

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
LaTeX has the capability to compile an index based on keywords marked in
 the text.
 Within LyX, this is done using 
\family typewriter
index-insert
\family default
 immediately adjacent to the word or phrase to be placed in the index.
 Note that leaving a space in between can occasionally result in the page
 number appearing in the index to be off by one page.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using 
\family typewriter
index-insert
\family default
 from the minibuffer, an argument can be used to give the text to use in
 the index entry.
 Regardless of how the entry was created in LyX, clicking on the index inset
 gives an editable popup window to allow changes in the entry.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insert a label (and create a character string label key for it) for use
 in a cross-reference to either the current environment entity or the printed
 page number of the label location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command inserts a LaTeX 
\family typewriter

\backslash
label{key}
\family default
 command into the document, which contains a case-sensitive alphanumeric
 label 
\family typewriter
key
\family default
 that you define.
 This command allows LaTeX to track the current environment and printed
 page number for subsequent
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Actually, it doesn't need to be a subsequent reference.
 You can reference a label 
\emph on
before
\emph default
 it is defined, but you must then run LaTeX multiple times to allow LaTeX
 to resolve these types of references.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 cross-reference via the 
\family typewriter
ref-insert
\family default
 command.
 The current environment is the section, table, figure, equation, enumerated
 item, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
., that the label is within.
 Note that the actual printed label is not displayed until you view or print
 your document; LyX displays instead on the screen the symbolic label, which
 is the character string label that you defined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that you can't define labels for math equations using this command.
 LyX labels equations using a combination of the 
\family typewriter
math-number
\family default
 command and the actual LaTeX command 
\family typewriter

\backslash
label{key}
\family default
.
 See the User's Guide for more information about labelling and numbering
 equations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the current environment is a section, as it is here at this point, you
 can insert a label with the following result:
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "test label"

\end_inset

.
 This label can then be referenced, and the result will be the section number
 for this section, as Section
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "test label"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

 method in the LyX User's Guide or any LaTeX user's guide.

\begin_layout Standard
This function requires an argument, which is the name of the paragraph environme

 Yes, we realize the nomenclature is confusing.
 Unfortunately, we've changed our terminology but not the function names.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are more possible arguments than those listed in the keybindings.
 In fact, the possible arguments change depending on what document class
 you're using.
 In any case, there are so many different paragraph environments that we
 couldn't go into detail about each one here.

\begin_layout Standard
In the LaTeX preamble, you can insert non-standard LaTeX parameter settings

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each document has its own preamble.
 LyX currently adds certain commands to the preamble based on settings you've
 chosen from within LyX.
 Some things LyX just can't do yet, but LaTeX can.
 Or, you may want to use some custom LaTeX macros.
 The 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is a typical preamble that changes default settings for twocolumn
 mode, creates a simple custom LaTeX command for later use in this document,
 and then reads in some other personal settings and/or macros from an external
 file.
 Remember, if you want your documents to be portable, you need to bundle
 any such external files with the document file(s):

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Self explanatory.
 Different languages use different symbols for the default quotes.
 For example, French uses 
\begin_inset Quotes fld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes frd
\end_inset

, not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Selecting a different type of quote changes the behavior of the 
\family sans

 LyX supports a bunch of different quotes.
 If you need a special one not present, contact

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insert an interword space at which a line break will not be allowed either
 on the LyX screen or in the LaTeX output.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The protected space is represented on the screen as a small, magenta, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

square cup
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 symbol, like this 
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

, which if you are reading a printed copy looks something like 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqcup$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is sometimes also called a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fixed space
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because it is not resized like other whitespace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Use the protected space for phrases that you don't want broken at the end
 of a line, or to insert more than one word into certain kinds of headings.
 For example, the 
\family sans
Description
\family default
 list always treats the first word of the paragraph as an item label and
 boldfaces it.
 If you wanted to use more than one word as an item label, use protected
 space between the words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Never
\emph default
 use 
\family typewriter
protected-space
\family default
 as a substitute tab-stop! LyX has far, far better ways of formatting text,
 so use them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This phrase, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the

whole
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

nine
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

yards,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will not be broken at the end of a line.
 And if we had a description list with multi-word labels:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
entry
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

#1 This is one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
entry
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

#2 This is two.
 Notice the protected space between the words in the item label.

Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insert a typewriter-style double quote symbol, ", at the current cursor
 location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the default keyboard, the grave and apostrophe keys produce matching
 single quote characters, and the double-quote key produces context-sensitive
 anti-symmetric double quotes.
 While it should normally be used only in rare situations, the 
\family typewriter
quote-insert
\family default
 command allows you to easily produce the less esthetically pleasing typewriter-
style double quote symbol.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command also allows you to create a double-quote character when you've
 changed the behavior of the 
\family sans

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\family default
 key using the 
\family typewriter
layout-quotes
\family default
 command.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Purpose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Insert a cross-reference (using a character string label key), based on
 a previously defined label.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Usage:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This command inserts either a LaTeX 
\family typewriter

\backslash
ref{key}
\family default
 or a 
\family typewriter

\backslash
pageref{key}
\family default
 command, as appropriate, into the document.
 The 
\family typewriter
key
\family default
 parameter is the case-sensitive alphanumeric label that you previously
 defined using 
\family typewriter
label-insert
\family default
.
 Executing the 
\family typewriter
ref-insert
\family default
 command brings up the 
\family sans
Insert
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

Reference
\family default
 pop-up control panel, which shows you a selection list of previously defined
 references.
 Also on this panel, you are given the option of referencing either the
 environment reference related to that label (like the section number) or
 the page number at which the label is located.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\family typewriter

\backslash
ref(key)
\family default
 command allows LaTeX to track the specified key and substitute the appropriate
 cross-reference.
 The environment referenced can be a section, table, figure, equation number,
 enumerated item, 
\emph on
etc
\emph default
.
 Note that the actual printed label is not displayed until you view or print
 your document; LyX displays instead on the screen the symbolic label, which
 is the character string label key that you defined.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that labels defined in math mode don't become visible to the 
\family sans

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See 
\family typewriter
label-ref
\family default
 for an example of referencing a section number.
 That same label from that example can also be used to reference the page
 number at that location; for example, the page number of that location
 is Page
