		How to support the seminar package in LyX
	       ===========================================

         Seminar.cls is a nice LaTeX2e package aimed a producing
       nice and clear slides. It can work together with pstricks and
       the color package, and can procduce fance slides indeed.

       The seminar class has some important class options: 
	   - article   Produce the whole seminar document as a regular
	               latex article with the slides as floating
		       bodies and the notes as running text.
	   - slidesonly Generates only the slides, not the notes.
	   - notesonly Generates only the notes.
	   -

           Variables for the slide environment
           ===================================

	   \slideleftmargin
	   \sliderightmargin
	   \slidetopmargin
	   \slidebottommargin
	   \paperwidth
	   \paperheight
	   ... and a lot of others

	   Goal
	   ====

	   The ultimate goad would be to be able to do all that is
	   done in the Seminar FAQ inside LyX.
