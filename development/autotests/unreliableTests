# size and orientation depending on the output format and viewing application.

# Babel-Spanish uses UTF-8 encoded "unicode" strings if it detects LuaTeX
# (with TeXLive 2016 also for XeTeX).
# With LuaTeX and 8-bit TeX-fonts, e.g., the toc heading becomes
# ÃŊndice instead of Índice.
# The problem is generic to all Spanish documents but only manifests itself
# if Babel strings with non-ASCII chars are deployed.
# Set inputenc to utf8? (Changing the default in lib/languages
# requires more tests for utf8 first.)
