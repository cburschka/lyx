# Finding regexps within \frac{}
# From what I understand, the point of the test is that search should _not_
# match in this case because "ignore format" is checked by default.  Thus, a
# way of testing that there was no match is to check whether the wrap around
# message shows up, because the cursor is initially at the beginning so that
# would mean that the entire buffer was checked. This test is still fragile:
# It will fail if the Italian translation changes, if "ignore format" is
# unchecked by default, or if the wrap-around mechanism changes (e.g. does not
# ask if the cursor started at the beginning of the buffer).
