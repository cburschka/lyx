# Sample test script for regression tests
#
# Adapted from the syntax of the original testkeys.py by McCabe-Dansted.
# Run this script by providing it as single argument to run-test.sh
#
# WARNING: Syntax is poorly parsed: no extra spaces anywhere
#
# Lines starting with a '#' on the 1st column are comments
#
# Exec <cmd...>
#   Causes the execution of <cmd...> in a os.system()
#
# TestBegin <args...>
#   Starts a test case under deterministic conditions:
#   Any currently running instance of LyX is killed
#   A new LyX instance is spawned, with the command-line arguments
#   specified in <args...>.
#
# TestEnd <cmd...>
#   Ends a test case, killing the LyX instance under test, and
#   executing the <cmd...> commands into an os.system(). The exit status
#   of the commands sequence determines success or failure of the test.
#   This is equivalent to:
#     TestEnd
#     Assert <cmd...>
#
# Assert <cmd...>
#   Executes the <cmd...> commands into an os.system() and, if the
#   exit status is non-zero, then abort the test execution making it fail.
#
# Lang <lang>
#   Sets the environment variable LANG to <lang>. Useful before launching
#   LyX (i.e., before a TestBegin command, in order to set deterministically
#   the language settings, which impacts the actual key sequences needed to
#   operate within LyX. This way, different developers can write different
#   test cases in different languages and still they can be executed by
#   anyone.
#
# KK: <chars...>
#   Feeds the running LyX instance with the specified key characters.
#   Special sequences:
#     \A<char> ...... sends the sequence [Alt+<char>]
#     \[<dir>] ...... sends a cursor movement, <dir> = Right, Left, Up, Down
#     \[Tab] ........ sends a Tab character
#     \[Return] ..... sends a Return
#
# KD: n
#   Changes the delay among typed charactes to n milliseconds.
#
# Sleep f
#   Single delay of f seconds.
#
#
# This example instructs LyX to type "Hello World", then exports it as
# LaTeX, and verifies that the typed characters are indeed present in the
# exported document.
#
TestBegin test.lyx -dbg key > lyx-log.txt 2>&1
KK: Hello World
KK: \Cs
KK: \Axbuffer-export latex\[Return]
TestEnd grep "Hello World" test.tex
