This file documents (finally) some of the 'dependencies' needed to build 
the Windows installer.

ImageMagick
	ImageMagick-7.0.8-15-Q16-x86-dll.exe
	The version number will of course vary. Basically, it seems that we just
	need to install this, and then copy the installed files over into the 
	Dependencies folder.
	It would be nice to know if we could instead use the portable version.
