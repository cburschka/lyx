All .fd files go in this directory.
Each .fd file should have just one form in them

NOTE: An exception to the above is any tabbed form which 
      xforms requires multiple forms to create.  In that case
      the group of forms constitutes one gui form.

* All forms should be named form_xxx and saved into a file of the same name.
For example, the copyright notice is called form_copyright and is stored in
form_copyright.fd.
Tabbed folders should be named form_xxx_yyy.
For example, the file folder in the graphics dialog has the identifier
form_graphics_file.

If you match this pattern, the fdfix.sh script will be able to manipulate
the generated .c and .h files to produce the .C and .h files used by LyX. A form
called form_xxx will result in a struct FD_xxx.

* Name all buttons and other form components that are likely to cause a
callback. The names should be of the form:  button_ok, radio_group_item and
so on.

Being more explicit:
	class             | prefix
	------------------+-------
	FL_BROWSER        | browser
	FL_BUTTON         | button
	FL_PIXMAPBUTTON   | button
	FL_CHECKBUTTON    | check
	FL_CHOICE         | choice
	FL_COUNTER        | counter
	FL_DIAL           | dial
	FL_INPUT          | input
	FL_FRAME          | frame
	FL_LABELFRAME     | frame
	FL_ROUND3DBUTTON,
	RADIO_BUTTON      | radio
	FL_SLIDER         | slider
	FL_VALSLIDER      | slider
	FL_TABFOLDER      | tabfolder
	FL_TEXT           | text

The only exceptions to this are objects that are to be converted in the sed
scripts. At the moment this applies only to bmtable:

	Convert an FL_BUTTON to a FL_BMTABLE by using prefix "bmtable".

Enter the full name of the callback eg.:
        C_FormBaseOkCB

If you follow these simple rules then you will generate code for functions
build_xxx that will need no further editing to make them work. For example,
form_graphics.h contains the struct declarations and build methods, so:

extern FD_graphics * build_graphics(void *);
extern FD_graphics_file * build_graphics_file(void *);
extern FD_graphics_size * build_graphics_size(void *);
extern FD_graphics_bbox * build_graphics_bbox(void *);
extern FD_graphics_special * build_graphics_special(void *);
extern FD_graphics_lyxview * build_graphics_lyxview(void *);

where the function is to be passed a pointer to the parent dialog
(usually "this") so that this pointer can be cast off to FormBase * in the
assigned callback function and the appropriate class method called.
