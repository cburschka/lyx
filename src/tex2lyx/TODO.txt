This file lists features that are supported by LyX but not yet converted (or
not converted completely) by tex2lyx. Currently, (all?) features up to the
current file format are listed. The table is organized in three columns:


Format:        First file format that supports the feature. In some cases the
               feature may habe been revised in later file formats.
LaTeX feature: LaTeX package, command or environment
LyX feature:   LyX inset or document setting

        - Dia and LilyPond are an \includegraphics and can therefore only be imported as image
        - Chess diagram, PDF pages and Spreadsheet are supported)
       (Xfig figure, Lilypond, Dia diagram can be supported by looking at the file extension)

General

* Use the language information provided by Language.cpp and the languages file (for babel/lyx/polyglossia name, quote style etc.)
  instead of hardcoding this information in Preamble.cpp.

* Store alias commands for characters in a file with
  "lib/unicodesymbols"-format, e.g.

    0x200b "\\dots" "" "" "" # HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
    0x200b "\\ldots" "" "" "\\ldots" # HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS
    0x200b "\\textellipsis" "" "" "" # HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS

  Look up LaTeX->Unicode conversion in the combined files.
