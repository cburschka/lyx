\noindent This paragraph is not indented.

\section{References}

Let's start with simple things: a label~\label{lab:test} and a
reference~\ref{lab:test}; note that I have tested ``unbreakable
space'' without warning (and worse than that, I just tested english
quotes too...).

Of course there are other kind of references, like page
reference~\pageref{lab:test}, but also equation
reference~\eqref{lab:test} (from amsmath package), or varioref's
equivalents~\vref{lab:test} and~\vpageref{lab:test}, without
forgetting pretty references like~\prettyref{lab:test}.

\section{Input files}

We can input files too, like this \input{DummyDocument}, or with the include
variant \include{DummyDocument}

If you prefer verbatim input, you can choose
between~\verbatiminput{foo} or~\verbatiminput*{foo}.

\section{Lists}

\listoffigures
\listoftables

\section{Graphics}

There is also some basic support for graphics, in the form
\includegraphics{foo.eps}, or the slightly more elaborate
\includegraphics[bb=10bp 0bp 96bp 96bp,clip,height=1cm, width=1cm]{foo.eps}.

\section{Special formattings}

\subsection{LyX line}

test

{\tiny \lyxline{\tiny}}{\tiny \par}

test {\Huge Test} {\tiny test} test

\lyxline{\normalsize}

test

{\Huge \lyxline{\Huge}}{\Huge \par}

test

\subsection{Line breaks}

They can also or be broken by a newline\\
or a newline command \newline
or by a line break \linebreak
or by a defined line break \linebreak[4]

There are even newlines with weird arguments, but these are not
handled by LyX\\*[1cm]
so we try to use ERT in this case.

\subsection{Page breaks}

They can also or be broken by a newpage \newpage
or by a page break \pagebreak
or by a defined page break \pagebreak[4]

\section{Special characters}

Then one has those macros with a long name for a short meaning, like
\textasciitilde, \textasciicircum{} or \textbackslash{}, and the characters
that LaTeX wants to espace because they are active, like \_\&\#\$\{\}\%.

And what about special characters like hyphe\-nation mark,
ellipsis\ldots, and end-of-sentence\@. LyX also supports a menu
separator\lyxarrow{}and a spif\textcompwordmark{}fy ligature break.
