This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 2.0.2, some 
known problems in LyX 2.0.x and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 2.0.x series.
Fixes may be available for some of these but not yet have been applied, due
to incomplete testing.

Interface changes in 2.0.x
--------------------------

There have been some changes to the LyX command line. There is a new option 
"--batch" that causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI 
window. Thus, something like:
    lyx -batch -x "buffer-print printer default dvips" myfile.lyx
will cause LyX to print myfile.lyx to the default printer, using dvips and 
the default print settings (which, of course, have to have been configured 
already). At present, not many commands can be used this way, but there will
be more eventually.

A bash completion script was added to the tarball.

We have introduced a new flag to decide whether or not a given "document"
format shall be listed in the File > Export menu. This was necessary since
this menu got too large. If the flag "menu=export" is not explicitly set,
the formats are not included in the menu. This means that you might need
to click "Show in export menu" in Preferences > File Formats for your
customized file formats if you want them to appear in the menu.
Customized formats imported from a previous configuration are handled
by the prefs2prefs script, and should appear in the menu as before.
Note, though, that you still can export to any possible format via
File > Export > More Formats and Options ...

The following pref variables were changed in 2.0:

- \language_package was renamed to \language_custom_package

- \language_use_babel (bool) has been replaced by 
  \language_package_selection, which can be
  0 (automatic selection)
  1 (always use babel)
  2 custom (use the custom package defined by
    \language_custom_package)
  3 none (equivalent to former \language_use_babel false)

The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.0:

- \plaintext_roff_command (was not used anymore)

- \personal_dictionary, \spell_command, \use_input_encoding,
  \use_personal_dictionary and \use_spell_lib (ispell support has been
  removed)

- \spellchecker_use_alt_lang and \use_escape_chars (actually not used
  by the UI, and it is as simple to check whether the relevant
  variable is empty)

- \custom_export_command and \custom_export_format


The following new LyX functions have been introduced:

- LFUN_WORD_FINDAD ("word-findadv").
- LFUN_REGEXP_MODE ("regexp-mode").
- LFUN_PHANTOM_INSERT ("phantom-insert").
- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN ("inset-begin").
- LFUN_INSET_END (""inset-end"").
- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN_SELECT ("inset-begin-select").
- LFUN_INSET_END_SELECT ("inset-end-select").
- LFUN_CHANGE_PREVIOUS ("change-previous").
- LFUN_LABEL_INSERT_AS_REF ("label-insert-as-reference").
- LFUN_SECTION_SELECT ("section-select").
- LFUN_FONT_UNDERLINE ("font-underline").
- LFUN_FONT_STRIKEOUT ("font-strikeout").
- LFUN_FONT_UULINE ("font-underunderline").
- LFUN_FONT_UWAVE ("font-underwave").
- LFUN_BRANCHES_RENAME ("branches-rename").
- LFUN_BRANCH_ADD_INSERT ("branch-add-insert").
- LFUN_BUFFER_CLOSE_ALL ("buffer-close-all").
- LFUN_INSET_FORALL ("inset-forall").
- LFUN_DEBUG_LEVEL_SET ("debug-level-set").
- LFUN_INSET_SELECT_ALL ("inset-select-all").
- LFUN_MATH_AMS_MATRIX ("math-ams-matrix").
- LFUN_VC_COMPARE ("vc-compare").
- LFUN_SPELLING_ADD ("spelling-add").
- LFUN_SPELLING_IGNORE ("spelling-ignore").
- LFUN_SPELLING_REMOVE ("spelling-remove").
- LFUN_PREVIEW_INSERT ("preview-insert").
- LFUN_FORWARD_SEARCH ("forward-search").
- LFUN_INSET_COPY_AS ("inset-copy-as").
- LFUN_BUFFER_TOGGLE_OUTPUT_SYNC ("buffer-toggle-output-sync").


The following LyX functions have been removed:

- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_TOGGLE ("next-inset-toggle"): use "inset-toggle" instead.
- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_MODIFY ("next-inset-modify"): use "inset-modify" instead.
- LFUN_PARAGRAPH_SPACING ("paragraph-spacing"): use "paragraph-params" instead.

- LFUN_NOTES_MUTATE ("notes-mutate"): replace
    notes-mutate <SOURCE> <TARGET>
  with the more general function inset-forall
    inset-forall Note:<SOURCE> inset-modify note Note <TARGET>

- LFUN_ALL_INSETS_TOGGLE ("all-insets-toggle"): replace
    all-insets-toggle <ACTION> <TARGET>
    all-insets-toggle <ACTION>
  with the more generic function inset-forall
    inset-forall <TARGET> inset-toggle <ACTION>
    inset-forall * inset-toggle <ACTION>
  There is a difference in the <TARGET> parameter, which is would be
  like "note" in the first case and "Note" in the second.

- LFUN_TABULAR_FEATURE ("tabular-feature"): use "inset-modify" instead.
  I.e., "tabular-feature FEATURE <ARGS>" becomes:
    inset-modify tabular FEATURE <ARGS>

- LFUN_LINE_INSERT ("line-insert"): use "inset-insert line" instead. For
  something close to the previous default, use:
    inset-insert line rule height 0.25ex width 100col% \\end_inset
  This is necessary because the line inset now takes various arguments.

- LFUN_TOC_INSERT ("toc-insert"): use "inset-insert toc" instead.


The following LyX functions have been changed:

- LFUN_INSET_TOGGLE ("inset-toggle"): For some insets, this function was used 
  to show the settings dialog. This is no longer possible and one should use
  inset-settings for this purpose.
 
- LFUN_WORD_REPLACE ("word-replace"): The replacement and searched strings
  arguments have been inverted in order to allow the replacement of the word
  at current cursor position, even if it is not selected.

- LFUN_OPTIONAL_INSERT ("optional-insert") has been renamed LFUN_ARGUMENT_INSERT
  ("argument-insert").


The following LyX key bindings have been changed:

- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_FOLD ("math-macro-fold")
  The binding to "C-minus" has changed to "C-S-underscore".

- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_UNFOLD ("math-macro-unfold")
  The binding to "C-plus" has changed to "C-S-asterisk".

- On Mac OSX the modifier keys <Control> and <Option> are now treated separately.
  The distributed key binding for Mac OSX no longer uses the <Option> key for
  shortcuts with letters or numbers.

  The custom key bindings for <Option>/<Control> are mapped to the <Control>
  modifier only.

New external programs and libraries:
------------------------------------

LyX 2.0 introduces support for some new external helper programs/libraries,
while the support for some existing programs has been dropped. This
particularly applies to spell checking and the thesaurus.

1.) SPELLCHECKING:

* Direct support for ispell and hspell has been dropped. However, ispell
  and hspell are still accessible via the enchant wrapper (see below).

* Support for the aspell command line program has been dropped. Note that
  the aspell library (aspell 0.60.x) is still supported.
  
* As well as the aspell library, LyX now also supports hunspell (the spell
  checker used by OpenOffice and Firefox) and enchant, a wrapper that
  provides automatic access to many spell checking libraries (ispell,
  aspell, hspell, hunspell, etc.).
  System-wide hunspell dictionaries are in standard Linux installs
  looked up at /usr/local/share/lyx/dicts/.

* On Mac OSX, Apple's Spell Server is preconfigured as the "native" spell 
  checker.

LyX 2.0 is configured for any and all of these three possibilities,
given that the various libraries are installed on the machine where LyX is 
configured. The actual spell checker can be selected in Tools > Preferences.
Packagers are advised to pre-select whatever is most common on their
platform/distribution.

2.) THESAURUS:

* Support for the aiksaurus library has been dropped in favour of the
  MyThes thesaurus library (the thesaurus library used by OpenOffice).
  
* LyX ships the MyThes library itself, so unlike in LyX 1.6.x, no extra 
  thesaurus library needs to be installed. However, LyX does not ship any 
  thesaurus dictionaries, and those do have to be installed separately.

* The OpenOffice thesaurus dictionaries can be used, but the path to those
  dictionaries needs to be set in Tools > Preferences. Please refer to the
  UserGuide, sec. 6.14, for further instructions.
  In standard Linux installs the system-wide thesauri are looked up at
  /usr/local/share/lyx/thes/.

Packagers are advised to preset the thesaurus for their distribution/
platform. Packagers of installation bundles (on Windows and the Mac)
are advised to provide automatic installation of thesaurus dictionaries
in the installation process (analoguous to the spellchecker installation).

3.) LILYPOND:

There is now direct support for Lilypond-book. Note that LyX requires at
least version 2.14 for proper work.

4.) INSTANT PREVIEW:

Make sure that dv2dt (often part of LaTeX distributions) is installed
on your system. Instant preview wil be disabled if dv2dt is not found.

5.) LuaTeX support

For proper LuaTeX support you need to have at least TeXLive 2010.


Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 2.0.x
-------------------------------------------------------

- The support for using external files in ERT has been improved by the
  introduction of a prefix for the TEXINPUTS environment variable.
  This prefix can be set in preferences and by default includes the
  document directory (represented by a single '.'). The prefix can
  be set to any list of paths separated by the default separator for
  a given platform (':' on unix like systems and ';' on windows).
  When a file should be included by LaTeX, the paths listed in TEXINPUTS
  will be searched in turn for finding it. Note that any non-absolute
  path listed in the TEXINPUTS prefix is considered to be relative to the
  document directory, i.e., the directory where the LyX file lives.
  Users are advised to always include '.' (the document dir) as one of
  the path components, otherwise compilation may fail for some documents.
  This is because the previous (undocumented) mechanism based on the use
  of the \input@path macro has been dropped. The old mechanism did not
  work in all cases and was kind of a hack. Old documents using that
  undocumented hack for obtaining the path of the LyX file will have to
  be revised. A clean way for obtaining the document path is using the
  info inset through the "info-insert buffer path" LyX function.

- The typeset of your documents with non-english language can slightly
  change in case of math environments and floats (this is usually the case
  with certain modules which provide specific environments like AMS ones
  or provide specific floats like the linguistic one).

  LyX now uses its own translation machinery which will automatically provide
  localization strings used so far only in GUI. The status of translation to
  your language can be seen in lib/layouttranslation file. This is not meant as
  a babel replacement (still used), but rather extension for strings not
  translated by babel at all.

- The syntax of the languages file has been changed. If you use a modified
  languages file, you will need to adapt it to the new syntax, as LyX 2.0
  is not able to read old languages file anymore.
  Please refer to the beginning of the languages file for an explanation
  of the new syntax.

- There has been a large change in how Flex insets are named. Previously,
  they tended to have names like "CharStyle:Noun". Now, they just have
  names like "Flex:Noun" (where the "Flex" prefix is now required). When 
  LyX 2.0 reads older files, it silently converts the old-style names
  to new-style names; this direction works almost perfectly. The one place
  it does not work is with CopyStyle declarations, IF your old InsetLayout
  was NOT named "CharStyle:..." or "Custom:..." or "Element:...", but, say,
  just "MyInset". In that case, "InsetLayout MyInset" will be changed to
  "InsetLayout Flex:MyInset", but "CopyStyle MyInset" will be left as is.
  Users will need to make that kind of change manually. The best way to do
  this is to use the layout2layout.py script, which gets installed in
  $LYXDIR/scripts/layout2layout.py, to convert your custom layout files to
  the new format, and then check them for correctness.
   
  LyX will also silently revert new-style names to old-style names when 
  exporting to 1.6.x format, but only for the pre-defined LyX insets. This 
  means that user-defined flex insets will not be properly reverted. To solve 
  this problem, you can modify the file $LYXDIR/lyx2lyx/lyx_2_0.py. In that 
  file, you will find the following:
    flex_insets = {
      "Alert" : "CharStyle:Alert",
      "Code" : "CharStyle:Code",
      "Concepts" : "CharStyle:Concepts",
      "E-Mail" : "CharStyle:E-Mail",
      "Emph" : "CharStyle:Emph",
      "Expression" : "CharStyle:Expression",
      "Initial" : "CharStyle:Initial",
      "Institute" : "CharStyle:Institute",
      "Meaning" : "CharStyle:Meaning",
      "Noun" : "CharStyle:Noun",
      "Strong" : "CharStyle:Strong",
      "Structure" : "CharStyle:Structure",
      "ArticleMode" : "Custom:ArticleMode",
      "Endnote" : "Custom:Endnote",
      "Glosse" : "Custom:Glosse",
      "PresentationMode" : "Custom:PresentationMode",
      "Tri-Glosse" : "Custom:Tri-Glosse"
    }
  This is a map from new-style names (minux "Flex") to old-style names (and
  there is a similar for DocBook elements). To get a user-defined CharStyle
  to revert properly, it simply needs to be added to this list.

- The LyX support for Springer document classes has been updated to fulfill the
  latest guidelines of Springer. This has the side-effect that files, created
  with LyX 2.0.2 or newer, using a Springer document class will not be
  compilable with LyX versions older than LyX 2.0.2. The same applies for files
  created with LyX 1.6.10 or older that are saved with LyX 2.0.2 or newer.


Note: There may later be an updated list of known issues online at
	http://wiki.lyx.org/LyX/ReleaseNotes

- UI layout named "classic.ui" and some localized keyboard bindings (sv,pt,fi)
  were long time unmaintained and we do not ship it anymore.
