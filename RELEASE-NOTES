This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 2.0.0, some 
known problems in LyX 2.0.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 2.0.x series.
Note that fixes are available for some of these, but they have not yet
been applied because of incomplete testing.


Interface changes
-----------------

There have been some changes to the LyX command line. There is a new option 
"--batch" that causes LyX to run the given commands without opening a GUI 
window. Thus, something like:
    lyx -batch -x "buffer-print printer default dvips" myfile.lyx
will cause LyX to print myfile.lyx to the default printer, using dvips and 
the default print settings (which, of course, have to have been configured 
already). At present, not many commands can be used this way, but there will
be more eventually.

Bash completion script was added to the tarball.

The following variables are obsoleted in 2.0

- \plaintext_roff_command (was not used anymore)

- \personal_dictionary, \spell_command, \use_input_encoding,
  \use_personal_dictionary and \use_spell_lib (ispell support has been
  removed)

- \spellchecker_use_alt_lang and \use_escape_chars (actually not used
  by the UI, and it is as simple to check whether the relevant
  variable is empty)

- \custom_export_command and \custom_export_format


The following new LyX functions have been introduced:

- LFUN_WORD_FINDAD ("word-findadv").

- LFUN_REGEXP_MODE ("regexp-mode").

- LFUN_PHANTOM_INSERT ("phantom-insert").

- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN ("inset-begin").

- LFUN_INSET_END (""inset-end"").

- LFUN_INSET_BEGIN_SELECT ("inset-begin-select").

- LFUN_INSET_END_SELECT ("inset-end-select").

- LFUN_CHANGE_PREVIOUS ("change-previous").

- LFUN_LABEL_INSERT_AS_REF ("label-insert-as-reference").

- LFUN_SECTION_SELECT ("section-select").

- LFUN_FONT_UNDERLINE ("font-underline").

- LFUN_FONT_STRIKEOUT ("font-strikeout").

- LFUN_FONT_UULINE ("font-underunderline").

- LFUN_FONT_UWAVE ("font-underwave").

- LFUN_BRANCHES_RENAME ("branches-rename").

- LFUN_BRANCH_ADD_INSERT ("branch-add-insert").

- LFUN_BUFFER_CLOSE_ALL ("buffer-close-all").

- LFUN_INSET_FORALL ("inset-forall").

- LFUN_DEBUG_LEVEL_SET ("debug-level-set").

- LFUN_INSET_SELECT_ALL ("inset-select-all").

- LFUN_MATH_AMS_MATRIX ("math-ams-matrix").

- LFUN_VC_COMPARE ("vc-compare").

- LFUN_SPELLING_ADD ("spelling-add").

- LFUN_SPELLING_IGNORE ("spelling-ignore").

- LFUN_SPELLING_REMOVE ("spelling-remove").

- LFUN_PREVIEW_INSERT ("preview-insert").

- LFUN_FORWARD_SEARCH ("forward-search").

- LFUN_INSET_COPY_AS ("inset-copy-as").


The following LyX functions have been removed:

- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_TOGGLE ("next-inset-toggle"): use "inset-toggle" instead.

- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_MODIFY ("next-inset-modify"): use "inset-modify" instead.

- LFUN_PARAGRAPH_SPACING ("paragraph-spacing"): use "paragraph-params" instead.

- LFUN_NOTES_MUTATE ("notes-mutate"): replace
    notes-mutate <SOURCE> <TARGET>
  with the more general function inset-forall
    inset-forall Note:<SOURCE> inset-modify note Note <TARGET>

- LFUN_ALL_INSETS_TOGGLE ("all-insets-toggle"): replace
    all-insets-toggle <ACTION> <TARGET>
    all-insets-toggle <ACTION>
  with the more generic function inset-forall
    inset-forall <TARGET> inset-toggle <ACTION>
    inset-forall * inset-toggle <ACTION>
  There is a difference in the <TARGET> parameter, which is would be
  like "note" in the first case and "Note" in the second.

- LFUN_TABULAR_FEATURE ("tabular-feature"): use "inset-modify" instead.


The following LyX functions have been changed:

- LFUN_INSET_TOGGLE ("inset-toggle"): For some insets, this function was used 
  to show the settings dialog. This is no longer possible and one should use
  inset-settings for this purpose.
 
- LFUN_WORD_REPLACE ("word-replace"): The replacement and searched strings
  arguments have been inverted in order to allow the replacement of the word
  at current cursor position, even if it is not selected.

- LFUN_OPTIONAL_INSERT ("optional-insert") has been renamed LFUN_ARGUMENT_INSERT
  ("argument-insert").


The following LyX key bindings have been changed:

- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_FOLD ("math-macro-fold")
  The binding to "C-minus" has changed to "C-S-underscore".

- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_UNFOLD ("math-macro-unfold")
  The binding to "C-plus" has changed to "C-S-asterisk".


New external programs and libaries:
-----------------------------------

LyX 2.0 introduces support for some new external helper programs/libraries,
while the support for some existing programs has been dropped. This
particularly applies to spell checking and the thesaurus.

1.) SPELLCHECKING:

* Direct support for ispell and hspell has been dropped. However, ispell
  and hspell are still accessible via the enchant wrapper (see below).

* Support for the aspell command line program has been dropped. Note that
  the aspell library (aspell 0.60.x) is still supported.
  
* Next to aspell (library), LyX now also supports hunspell (the spell
  checker used by OpenOffice and Firefox) and enchant, a wrapper that
  provides automatic access to many spell checking libraries (ispell,
  aspell, hspell, hunspell, etc.).

* On Mac Apples Spell Server is preconfigured as "native" spell checker.

LyX 2.0 is configured for any and multiple of these three possibilities,
given that they are installed on the machine where LyX is configured on.
The actual spell checker can be selected in Tools > Preferences.
Packagers are advised to pre-select whatever is most common on their
platform/distribution.

2.) THESAURUS:

* Support for the aiksaurus library has been dropped in favour of the
  MyThes thesaurus library (the thesaurus library used by OpenOffice).
  
* LyX ships the MyThes library itself, so contrary to LyX 1.6.x, no
  extra thesaurus library needs to be installed. However, LyX does not
  ship any thesaurus dictionary.

* The OpenOffice thesaurus dictionaries can be used, but the path to those
  dictionary needs to be set in Tools > Preferences. Please refer to the
  UserGuide, sec. 6.13, for further instructions.

Packagers are advised to preset the thesaurus for their distribution/
platform. Packagers of installation bundles (on Windows and the Mac)
are advised to provide automatic installation of thesaurus disctionaries
in the installation process (analoguous to the spellchecker installation).
