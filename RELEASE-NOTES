This file lists interface changes that might affect users in 2.1.0, some 
known problems in LyX 2.1.0 and some things you have to take into account
when upgrading from earlier versions to a version of the 2.1.x series.


Interface changes
-----------------

There have been some changes to the LyX command line. The following new
options have been added:

-export-to <format> <dest>    (-E <format> <dest>)

  Allows one to perform a batch export of the LyX file that is opened
  to the specified destination file <dest> and format <format>.
  For example, to create a PDF of a LyX document, you can run:
    lyx -export-to pdf /path/to/dest.pdf /path/to/source.lyx
  See the manual page for details.
  This functionality is also available via a new menu voice
  Export->Export As..., that pops up a dialog allowing one to
  choose the export format, as well as the destination pathname.
  Also, it is available via the mini-buffer (or the -x switch)
  through a proper new LFUN (see below).


The following pref variables were changed in 2.0:

The following pref variables are obsoleted in 2.0:

The following new LyX functions have been introduced:

- LFUN_BUFFER_EXPORT_AS <format> <filename>
  Equivalent to the new -export-to command-line switch (see above).

- LFUN_CLIPBOARD_PASTE_SIMPLE ("clipboard-paste-simple")
  Paste the clipboard contents as simple unformatted text.
  This is also available through a new menu voice within the
  [Edit]->[Paste Special...] sub-menu.

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_BUFFER_TOGGLE_OUTPUT_SYNC ("buffer-toggle-output-sync").


The following LyX functions have been removed:

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_NEXT_INSET_TOGGLE ("next-inset-toggle"): use "inset-toggle" instead.


The following LyX functions have been changed:

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_INSET_TOGGLE ("inset-toggle"): For some insets, this function was used 
  to show the settings dialog. This is no longer possible and one should use
  inset-settings for this purpose.
 

The following LyX key bindings have been changed:

//template, remove this entry later on
- LFUN_MATH_MACRO_FOLD ("math-macro-fold")
  The binding to "C-minus" has changed to "C-S-underscore".


New external programs and libraries:
------------------------------------

LyX 2.0 introduces support for some new external helper programs/libraries,
while the support for some existing programs has been dropped. This
particularly applies to spell checking and the thesaurus.


Known issues in version 2.0.0
-----------------------------

- LyX needs to be run under Python 2 and will not work properly on systems
  where Python 3 is the default binary. See bug #7030 to know how to fix
  this properly, since simple sheebang conversion in *.py files will not
  be enough.

Caveats when upgrading from earlier versions to 2.1.x
